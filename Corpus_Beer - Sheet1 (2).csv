RBC Downgrades Boston Beer Company Stock,"Another financial services firm has lowered Boston Beer Company’s stock (SAM). RBC Capital Partners today downgraded the company’s stock from an “outperform” rating to “sector perform.”
RBC analyst Nik Modi wrote that Boston Beer’s “volume woes have not hit a bottom just yet.” He added that feedback from distributors on the company’s new products has been “mixed.”
“We think it is best to sit on the sidelines until we get more comfort with volume trends and incrementality of innovation,” Modi wrote.
As such, RBC lowered its price target to $331, down from $488.
RBC’s downgrade follows downgrades from Goldman Sachs (sell) and Bernstein (neutral) analysts.
Modi attributed the downgrade to the performance of Truly Hard Seltzer, which accounts for about half of the company’s sales. The pressure on Truly is “too much to overcome in the near term,” Modi wrote.
Hard seltzer sales are down -10% year-to-date, with dollar sales declining -15% in recent weeks in off-premise channels tracked by market research firm IRI, Modi wrote. Meanwhile, volume is down -20% over the last four-week period.
Citing Numerator data, Modi added that hard seltzer household penetration is now at 29.2% in the latest week, down 80 basis points compared to the start of the year and down 100 bps compared to mid-March. Meanwhile, repeat rates “have fared better,” but are also down compared to March (down 20 bps).
Although buy rates of hard seltzer are still up low-single-digits year-over-year in recent weeks, it “continues to see a sequential deceleration,” Modi wrote.
“While category [comparisons] should get easier, transitioning to MSD-HSD% [mid-single digits to high-single digits] comps for the remainder of the year starting in late June-early July, the current category velocities and two year trends continue to decelerate on an underlying basis making it more difficult to support a reversal of trends,” Modi wrote. “Truly’s share of hard seltzer has also regressed in the last 4 weeks and the overall hard seltzer category continues to lose share of overall beer.”
Boston Beer management had forecast 0-10% growth for the overall hard seltzer segment in 2022. Year-to-date in IRI tracked channels, the segment is declining -10%.
“Given seltzers’ recent performance, we see the category underachieving that target, even as comps ease,” Modi wrote.
“SAM’s shipment/depletion guidance of +4% to +10% implies ~HSD% depletion growth in the back half of the year as tracked channel underlying growth continues to decline,” Modi continued. “We ultimately see pressure to SAM’s FY’22 guidance due to Truly’s drag to overall growth. For the year, we see negative depletion growth as a reasonable outcome. With volumes in negative territory for the year, we acknowledge the long run growth trajectory of the business has greater uncertainty as seltzer/Truly velocities continue to slow and the company’s recent innovations remain unproven.”
On the bright side, Twisted Tea dollar sales have accelerated, up around 30% in tracked channels over the last four weeks, with the brand posting “strong growth in both ACV and total points of distribution.”
Boston Beer has received credit for its ‘needle-moving innovation over the year,” but it has has historically led to “boom-bust cycles as the company gets distribution and then repeat fades due to increased competition.” Although Boston Beer’s innovations this year have “done well gaining trial,” they have “struggled to be incremental overall.”
“Truly Margarita has reached ~4% share of hard seltzer, but share has come at the expense of previous innovations like Truly Lemonade, Punch, and Tea,” Modi wrote. “Our channel checks indicate Truly Vodka Seltzer is set to launch in August, which is late to capitalize on the peak summer selling season and support Truly growth needed this year. Bevy, which was launched this year, will be discontinued. Hard Mtn Dew has driven strong trial on limited distribution, but it remains too early to gauge ultimate potential.
“In the long term, we like SAM’s ability to innovate within the broader Beyond Beer space (seltzers, FMBs, RTDs, & ciders) but believe SAM will be in ‘prove it mode’ until clarity emerges regarding seltzer’s stabilization and innovation performance, both of which we believe will take time,” he continued.
RBC anticipates Boston Beer will lower its guidance due to pressures on Truly Hard Seltzer and the overall segment’s trends.
“With hard seltzer sales trends down double digits in recent periods, SAM’s category target of 0-10% growth is optimistic,” Modi wrote. “While we acknowledge the category [comparisons] get easier later in the year, underlying growth trends are also decelerating and we would find it most prudent if SAM guided to depletions continuing to decline on an underlying basis, which could be – MSD to HSD%. Given the cost environment we would also expect pricing to trend towards the higher end of their guided range 3-5%.”
SAM stock closed trading Thursday at $307.21, up $0.98 over the previous close. However, SAM stock is far below its 52-week high of $990.40, a tumble from its high-water mark that began on July 23, 2021.
Boston Beer will report its Q2 earnings on July 21 at 5 p.m. ET."
"Rhode Island based craft brewery and distillery, further expands its’ brand portfolio","Newport, R.I. — Newport Craft Brewing & Distilling Co., a Newport, Rhode Island based craft brewery and distillery, further expands its’ brand portfolio with the acquisition of Radiant Pig Beer Company. With Braven Brewing Company and Radiant Pig Beer Company, Newport Craft’s stable of products now includes 26 authentic beers, and over 10 craft spirit and cocktail labels.
Since launching in 2013, Radiant Pig has created innovative, high-quality beers with colorful names and stories inspired by the art, music, and culture of New York City. Radiant Pig’s year round favorites include its flagship IPA “Save the Robots”, “TV Party” a New England pale ale, “Own the Night” Hazy IPA, “It Ain’t Easy” Double IPA, “No Half Steppin” Single Hop IPA, and “Junior”, a session IPA.
“In order to continue to deliver the level of quality expected of Radiant Pig and to satisfy the ever-growing demand, it was important for me to find a partner with the same vision and commitment to quality and authenticity, and I found that in Newport Craft. Getting to know CEO Brendan O’Donnell and the Newport Craft team over the past year, we discovered that we not only shared a vision but a commitment to common values. After countless discussions with Brendan, I understood Newport Craft’s unwavering commitment to the craft brewing industry and where it sees itself on the regional and national brewing stage. I am thrilled about the partnership and the future of Radiant Pig,” said Rob Pihl, founder, master brewer and creative force behind Radiant Pig Beer Company.
In addition to taking an equity stake in the Company, Rob will join a Newport Craft team that has over 100 years of combined manufacturing, brewing, and distilling experience and will become the Company’s Brewmaster and Brand Ambassador. New addition Jessica Woodcome, who previously represented Magic Hat, Labatt USA, Genesee, Imperial, and Seagram’s Escape, will lead the Radiant Pig sales team with the single focus of expanding the brand’s presence on the shelves and in the taps in CT, MA and RI. Jessica will join the Company’s completely rebuilt sales team led by David Hall, Northeast Sales Manager, and Tarcizio DaSilvia, Tri State Sales Manager. Adding the Radiant Pig beers to the Company’s production schedule that already includes the Braven Brewing and Newport Craft portfolios will push the Company’s production to 10,000 barrels by the end of the year and 25,000 barrels by 2022. Newport Craft has Radiant Pig in the tank and production and distribution will continue without interruption. Since taking over Newport Craft in 2017, Brendan and his team have solidified the Company’s spot as a leader on the New England craft brewing stage.
The Company has focused on its product lines, introducing new products, upgrading and expanding its manufacturing facility, and pursuing strategic acquisitions. Additionally, the Company is currently aging close to 1,000 barrels of Thomas Tew Rum and Sea Fog Whiskey; and has added gin, amaro, Newport Vodka, rye whisky, and reserve and spiced rums to its portfolio of spirits. Under Brendan’s leadership the Company has doubled its’ top line revenue, more than tripled its’ workforce, increased distribution to six states (CT, MA, NY, PA, RI, and ME), and has grown its social media platform to nearly 50,000 followers.
Newport Craft is now the largest combined brewing and distilling company in Rhode Island by production. The Thomas Tew Rum brand has been ranked amongst the top ten craft rums in America by USA Today, is a featured rum at Walt Disney World’s EPCOT, can be found on the top shelf of over 500 restaurants and bars and is the Official Rum of the New York Mets. Additionally, Newport Craft’s portfolio of beers, including Braven Brewing Company, are sold at the New York Mets’ Brooklyn and Queens area ballparks. Behind the strength of the Braven Brewing and Radiant Pig brands, Newport Craft will explore opportunities to open a tasting room in the New York City market.
To increase its brewing and distilling capacity and to meet the heightened market demand for its products, Newport Craft is in the process of doubling the production capacity of its current Newport, RI facility. The project will break ground in Summer 2020 with a projected 12 month build time. Once completed, the state-of-the-art facility will allow the Company to increase its brewing capacity with an eye towards 100,000 barrels per year with room to grow. The expanded facility will also allow the Company to separate the brewing and distilling operations. Not only will this new facility create the space for expansion and increased production, it will become a premier tourist attraction and venue allowing for each of the Company’s products to be displayed, tasted and enjoyed. The Company anticipates doubling its Rhode Island community workforce to meet production demands."
Craft Breweries forming a partnership with NA,"Two St. Louis craft breweries are forming a partnership.
Schlafly Beer and non-alcoholic beer maker WellBeing Brewing Co. announced a joint venture Thursday that will see Schlafly manage sales and production of WellBeing’s brands while also working with the company’s existing contract brewing and distribution partners.
Partnering with WellBeing gives Schlafly access to a portfolio of non-alcoholic beer brands with shared local roots.
In a statement, Schlafly CEO Fran Caradonna told Brewbound that “there has been no change in ownership or control of WellBeing or Schlafly.”
“The companies are working shoulder to shoulder as partners, each in their respective areas of strength, and sharing the profits,” she added.
“This is truly a joint venture. It allows us to scale our brand to a new level,” added WellBeing co-founder and CEO Jeff Stevens in a press release. “We can utilize Schlafly’s operational resources, yet still grow our brand under our vision. As craft brewers look for ways to adapt to a changing consumer landscape, non-alcoholic offerings are becoming essential. We believe that we can be a driver of innovation across the adult non-alcoholic space.”
WellBeing’s brands will be sold throughout Schlafly’s distribution footprint, which covers Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.
Caradonna told Brewbound that the two companies’ distribution “footprints have some overlap, but WellBeing’s distribution is wider while Schlafly’s is deeper.”
“We each use different wholesalers in our home market, but we won’t be making any changes as a result of this joint venture,” she added. “Our goal is to create and maintain the most effective distribution for both Schlafly and WellBeing, and sometimes that might mean they’re together in the same house and other times it may not.”
WellBeing will be able to leverage Schlafly’s management and operational capabilities, while maintaining its focus on innovation, overseeing product development, marketing, content, publicity and its e-commerce sales.
WellBeing’s offerings will continue to be contract produced at O’Fallon Brewery in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and New Realm Brewing’s Virginia Beach, Virginia, location. Schlafly will produce some WellBeing offerings in the future, but the company does “not plan to move all production here,” according to Caradonna.
“I expect increased sales will keep us all quite busy making WellBeing NA beers,” she added.
Schlafly will also manage back-of-house functions such as inventory, raw materials procurement, logistics and sales.
The JV is in effect immediately, with WellBeing beers brewed by Schlafly expected to hit retailers later this year.
Year-to-date through June 26, dollar sales of non-alcoholic beer are up +13.4%, to nearly $117.5 million, in multi-outlet and convenience stores tracked by market research firm IRI. NA beer’s share of beer category dollars have also increased .08%, to .61%. However, off-premise scans only capture part of the sales picture for NA beer producers, who are able to leverage e-commerce channels to sell their offerings directly to consumers. NA producers are also making headway into on-premise retailers, with Athletic Brewing recently gaining more than 1,000 placements at Buffalo Wild Wings stores.

Anheuser-Busch InBev Sells CA distributership,"Anheuser-Busch InBev has struck a deal to sell its Oakland, California-based wholly owned distributor to two independent wholesalers, Markstein Sales Company and Matagrano, Inc.
Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close July 29, were not disclosed.
“The strength of our wholesaler system is a critical element as we drive to deliver industry innovation and growth, and that includes both our industry-leading independent wholesaler network as well as our Anheuser-Busch facilities,” A-B chief commercial officer Kyle Norrington said in a press release.
“Anheuser-Busch’s owned distribution operations are a competitive advantage as they help us to develop future leaders, to test, pilot, and learn in the market, and ultimately to become better partners to our independent wholesalers and retail customers,” he continued. “We are pleased to transition our Oakland operations to two strong wholesaler partners, and we look forward to working together to accelerate our momentum in Northern California.”
Antioch-headquartered Markstein will sell A-B products in Oakland, while South San Francisco-based Matagrano will sell the portfolio in northern Santa Clara County and San Jose. Both distributors will maintain their current warehouse operations.
The added territory is a boon for Markstein, which received a termination notice from Constellation Brands earlier this year along with Visalia-based Bueno Beverage Company. Together, the two sold about 4 million case equivalents of Constellation products (Modelo, Corona, Pacifico).
“As a woman-owned, family-owned business with 102 years of local experience, we are proud of our long-term partnership with Anheuser-Busch as they continually demonstrate a willingness to support and work with their independent wholesalers as true partners,” president Laura Markstein said in the release. “We appreciate the opportunity to integrate Anheuser-Busch’s Oakland territory and members of its workforce into our operations and to continue bringing Anheuser-Busch’s leading portfolio of brands to our retail customers in this large and diverse community we call home.”
AB ONE Oakland joined A-B’s wholly owned distributor division in 2015, when it was acquired as Horizon Beverage from former owner Ces Butner, who now owns Speakeasy Ale & Lagers. A-B sold the Oakland distribution facility in May 2020 to Westcore Properties, an industrial real estate developer, for $40.5 million, according to CoStar.
That sale was the first in a string of deals AB ONE engaged in during the summer and fall of 2020. In July 2020, it swapped territories with Heimark Distributing in Southern California. In September 2020, A-B sold its wholly owned Colorado branch to Norcross, Georgia-based Eagle Rock Distributing. Two weeks later, A-B acquired Los Angeles-based Ace Beverage. A-B named Anson Frericks president of AB ONE last fall.
The moves are part of A-B’s “ongoing efforts to ensure the strongest possible route-to-market and the highest level of services for its retail customers across the different markets in which it operates,” according to the release.
“Over the last several years we have worked to structure our organization to drive growth and create value for our customers, consumers and communities,” A-B VP of business and wholesaler development Bob Tallett said in the release. “Northern California is an important market, so it was critical for us to find trusted partners that have a clear vision for this business. We will continue to work closely with Markstein and Matagrano to prioritize Anheuser-Busch employees and ensure a smooth and efficient transition.”
In addition to A-B products, Markstein’s portfolio includes offerings from Firestone Walker, Sierra Nevada, Lost Coast, Shiner, Deschutes and Fort Point. Matagrano’s portfolio includes offerings from Stone, Heineken USA, Firestone Walker, Deschutes and 21st Amendment.
A-B also operates AB ONE branches in Southern California, Oregon, Washington, Oklahoma, Ohio, Massachusetts and New York.
During Beer Business Daily’s Beer Industry Summit in January, North American zone CEO Brendan Whitworth noted that AB ONE branches at the time accounted for about 7% of the company’s volume.
A-B is limited to shipping no more than 10% of its volume through AB ONE, so the sale of AB ONE Oakland will drive that number down. It was as high as 9% in 2016, according to a letter the National Beer Wholesalers Association (NBWA) sent the Department of Justice (DOJ) to comment on the proposed A-B/SABMiller merger. At the time the NBWA called into question the veracity of A-B’s self-reported volume flowing through its own network.

CEO's Call on Repeal of Aluminum Tariffs,"CEOs Call on President to Repeal Section 232 Aluminum Tariffs
Leaders of the four largest U.S. beer manufacturers sent President Joe Biden a letter on July 1 calling for the repeal of the Section 232 tariffs imposed on aluminum by former President Donald Trump, saying “tariff relief results in inflation relief.”
The letter was signed by Gavin Hattersley, president and CEO of Molson Coors Beverage Company and chairman and acting president of the Beer Institute; Brendan Whitworth, CEO of Anheuser-Busch InBev’s North America zone; Jim Sabia, EVP and president of Constellation Brands’ beer division; and Maggie Timoney, CEO of Heineken USA.
They wrote that the tariffs continue to “burden breweries of all sizes.”
“Eliminating the tariffs will alleviate pressure and allow us to continue our vital role as strong contributors to this nation’s economy,” they wrote.
The CEOs added that the beer industry uses more than 41 billion aluminum cans a year, and since the implementation of the tariffs in 2018, the U.S. beverage industry has paid more than $1.4 billion in Section 232 tariffs. The tariffs have led to increased production costs for aluminum end-users and higher prices for consumers.
“Just as concerning is that of the $1.4 billion ostensibly paid in tariffs, 92% did not go to the U.S. Treasury,” they wrote. “We applaud your administration’s efforts to negotiate lifting tariffs off individual countries. However, those efforts to provide economic relief to American consumers have no effect if end-users – such as U.S. brewers – are charged a tariff-burdened price regardless of whether the metal should be tariffed based on its content or origin.”
The CEOs called on the Biden Administration to investigate “aluminum market manipulation and benchmarking” and “bring much needed transparency to the marketplace and relief to end-users and American families.”"
Modern Times Sale Take another turn,"The sale of Modern Times took another turn Thursday with the ultimate acquirer of the San Diego brewery still in question.
BX MT BAMF LLC, an affiliate of Anaheim, California-based Brewery X, which was awarded the ability to acquire Modern Times during a June 17 auction, has “elected not to complete the sale process,” according to a press release issued Thursday by Modern Times.
With Brewery X apparently out of the picture, Kihei, Hawaii-based Maui Brewing Company is next in line as the court-approved backup bidder, with a $15.3 million bid.
Although Maui has moved into the buyer’s seat, there remains a long way to go before the sale process closes. Maui chief operating officer Scott Metzger told Brewbound “there are a lot of legal complications as we figure out who the ultimate buyer of Modern Times will be.”
The sale is expected to close in October 2022, according to the release.
How We Got Here
The $20 million bid from Brewery X – via BX MT BAMF – to acquire Modern Times, with a 14-day closing window, was approved by the court during a June 24 hearing. The brewery backed out of the sale on July 1, according to Modern Times.
“This was an unexpected development in this process,” Modern Times CEO Jennifer Briggs said in a press release. “I am looking forward to working with [Maui Brewing] and finalizing the sale process and transitioning the business.
“The Modern Times Brewing team of employees and professional advisors engaged with BX MT BAMF, LLC representatives in a sprint-like fashion to meet the tight transition timeline for the closing date of July 8, 2022,” she continued. “This last-minute change is abrupt, yet it gives us the opportunity to be even more methodical. It allows [Maui Brewing] the time to finalize their acquisition process per their asset purchase agreement and how it will be additive to our craft brewing community.”
“Distressed sale processes often experience some turbulence, including on the buyer side,” Paul Buie, managing director of Onyx Asset Advisors, the company overseeing the sale of Modern Times, said in the release. “Thanks to the strong interest that developed in the Modern Times’ sale process, the Receiver was able to select and confirm [Maui Brewing] as the backup bidder at the June 17th auction.”
A Rollercoaster Sales Process
The sale process has taken several turns since Modern Times’ primary lender Zions Bancorporation (California Bank & Trust) initiated the court-approved sale process following the brewery defaulting on three loans totaling $12.9 million.
Last month, a wrench was thrown into the auction process when Modern Times’ court-appointed receiver, Thomas Hebrank, named Brewery X the winning bidder, even though MTD Asset Acquisition (MTD) made a higher offer at $20.1 million. MTD’s offer included a 120-day close period and the request for Hebrank to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the closing.
Michael B. Lubic, MTD’s attorney, filed an objection to the selection of Brewery X’s bid and submitted a new offer of $21 million with a 30-day close period and no Chapter 11 option on the grounds that the auction rules specified that non-monetary aspects, such as time to close, were not going to be considered as part of the auction.
“The auction was not conducted in accordance with the auction rules and the procedure was not fair, not commercially reasonable, and not designed to maximize value for the creditors,” Lubic wrote in the objection.
According to MTD’s asset purchase agreement included in Hebrank’s declaration, MTD is a Delaware-based LLC that lists K. Bagby Taylor as its president. Kurt Bagby Taylor is the founder of Next Glass, the parent company of Untappd, BeerAdvocate and Hop Culture; he exited the company following its sale in March 2020.
His father, George Taylor, is the CEO of Wilmington, North Carolina-based TRU Colors Brewery. According to notes in the auction bid log, MTD was bidding on behalf of TRU Colors. However, Kurt Taylor told WilmingtonBiz TRU Colors was not connected to the auction.
“The plan was to work through some of the challenges that Modern Times had,” Kurt Taylor told the business publication. “I really like the brand that they had built and thought that there was a lot of potential there to revive it. The employees there I thought were excellent – really skilled and good at their craft. My hope was to stabilize the business in Southern California and then potentially look to expand beyond there.”
Kurt Taylor has not responded to Brewbound’s request for comment.

North Carolina relaxes liquor Tax,"North Carolina Nixes Bill to Expand RTD Market Access
A bill that would have expanded market access for spirits-based, ready-to-drink (RTD) canned cocktails in North Carolina failed to advance in the state Legislature before it adjourned on July 1.
House Bill 904 would have created a new legal definition for RTDs between 0.5%-9.5% ABV as “low alcohol beverage coolers” that categorized them as fortified wine, paving the way for the spirits-based drinks to be sold outside of state-run liquor stores. North Carolina is a control state in which boards run by the county or municipal governments oversee the sale of spirits.
The Beer Institute (BI), the trade group that represents the nation’s larger brewers, called it “the latest in a string of similar moves that stand up for America’s beer businesses.”
“Lawmakers in North Carolina are sending a message to hard liquor: beer and liquor are not the same,” BI director of public affairs Alex Davidson said in a press release. “Large liquor companies don’t need special tax hand-outs, especially after recording more than $3.8 billion in profits last year. North Carolina lawmakers are right to focus their efforts on domestic job creators and working families who need help as they recover from the pandemic and face rising inflation.”
The spirits industry is advocating for lower excise taxes and expanded market access for RTDs, which have similar ABV levels to beer and products categorized as beer such as hard seltzers. Bills that would have achieved these goals stalled or failed during the legislative sessions in several states this year, including Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Washington and West Virginia, according to the BI.
Last month, Vermont enacted a law that created a separate class for RTDs up to 12% ABV, allowing them to be sold at licensed beer and wine retailers. In addition to expanding market access, Vermont also lowered excise tax from $7.68 per gallon to $1.10 per gallon, twice the rate for wine and quadruple the rate for beer.
In Michigan and Nebraska, which lowered RTD excise tax rates, retail prices for the products increased 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively, the BI said.

NJ Lawmakers backpeddle on Taproom restrictions,"NJ Lawmaker to Attempt Roll Back of Taproom Event Limitations
Following the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control’s (NJABC) move to enforce special conditions that restrict craft breweries’ ability to host events and offer food, state Sen. Michael Testa has announced he will introduce a bill to counter the restrictions.
The conditions – which Testa called “disastrous and destructive” in a press release – were introduced in 2019, but went unenforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The NJABC said they would begin enforcing the conditions during the 2022-2023 license cycle, which began on July 1.
“In my opinion, the ABC fell far short treating our local breweries fairly, which we must address with new legislation to aid these small businesses,” Testa said in the release. “These breweries, like most small businesses, suffered under Governor Murphy’s pandemic shutdowns and restrictions. To increase their burden with these new rules only adds insult to injury.”
Under the conditions, limited brewery licensees cannot coordinate with any food truck or pop-up food vendor to offer meals on brewery premises and are restricted to 25 public and 52 private on-site events per year, among other limitations. The 25 public events include activities such as trivia, paint nights, live music and yoga classes – all of which are regular occurrences at breweries nationwide. Breweries must notify NJABC 10 days prior to an event
Testa said he plans to introduce the legislation in several weeks during the next Senate quorum.

RTDs show strong growth,"Drizly: RTDs, Rice Lagers and BeatBox Big Winners in May
Ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages (RTDs) had another strong month on Drizly, continuing to drive summer sales growth on the e-commerce alcohol delivery platform, with “no signs of stopping,” according to Liz Paquette, Drizly’s head of consumer insights.
As previously reported, RTDs had a particularly strong Memorial Day weekend, passing hard seltzers in share of sales for the first time on the platform. The segment recorded a 4.8% share of sales on Drizly during the holiday, while hard seltzer recorded a 4.4% share.
RTD variety packs from brands such as Gallo’s High Noon Sun Sips, Anheuser-Busch InBev’s (A-B’s) Cutwater Spirits and Nütrl Vodka, led growth in the segment over the month, “indicating that summer get-togethers are starting early,” according to Drizly’s May consumer insights report.
Drizly also noted that consumers were ordering earlier in the week. Sunday (12%), Monday (13%) and Tuesday (13%) each gained three points order share month-over-over, while Monday and Tuesday also gained share year-over-year.
Other beyond beer brands recorded significant growth in the month, including BeatBox Beverages’ hard “party punch,” which had the largest year-over-year sales increase on Drizly, driven by flavors Fruit Punch, Tropical Punch and Blue Razzberry. Strainge Beast Hard Kombucha was one of the fastest growing beer brands year-over-year in May, with flavors such as Ginger, Lemon, and Hibiscus; Passion Fruit, Hops, and Blood Orange; and Blueberry, Acai, and Sweet Basil.
Rice lagers recorded the most growth in beer out of all other subsegments, led by brands such as Asahi, Orion Breweries and Berryessa Brewing Co. – a trend that carried over from March.

US beer Imports Fall,"U.S. beer shipments declined -2.2% in May 2022, to an estimated 14.6 million barrels, according to the Beer Institute, citing the latest domestic tax paid shipment estimates shared by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).
Year-to-date shipments through May 2022 are now down -3.3% year-over-year, to 66.9 million barrels shipped, 2.251 million fewer barrels than at this time in 2021 when brewers shipped 69.151 million barrels.
Shipments have now declined in four of the first five months of 2022 — January (-6.2%), February (-5.8%), April (-5.9%) and now May — with March (+2.9%) being the one outlier thus far.

New ECommerce Platform launches,"Bevana has launched a new e-commerce platform, allowing consumers in 42 states to buy and ship craft beer directly from producers around the world.
Bevana – formerly Community Brewing Ventures or CBV – was formed in 2020 to help small- and medium-sized craft beer producers get to market. Its portfolio of brands include Bay Cannon Beer Company (Tampa, Florida); Bold Mariner Brewing Company (Norfolk, Virginia); D9 Brewing Co. (Cornelius, North Carolina); Fatty’s Beer Works (Charleston, South Carolina); Side Hustle Brews & Spirits (United Arab Emirates); Steam Theory Brewing Co. (Dallas, Texas); Unknown Brewing (Newton, North Carolina); UpDog Kombucha (Newton, North Carolina); and Urban Brew Labs (Chicago, Illinois).
“Rather than buying inventory through the traditional three-tier system,” Bevana’s new platform “works directly with its partners” to connect drinkers to products, “without passing on hidden costs and fees to the customer,” according to a press release.
“Buying alcohol online has always been a frustrating, expensive process for many customers,” Matthew Juaire, Bevana’s director of e-commerce, said in the release. “Individual beverage companies can often only ship within their home state, and it’s a significant burden for them to manage even then. For other marketplaces, oftentimes they either have to warehouse enormous amounts of products that they may never be able to sell, or they have to buy it directly from a retailer. Either way, that’s a lot of added expense that usually gets passed on to the customer.
“With Bevana, we can offer an unbeatable selection of different beverages without that extra step,” he continued. “That gives us the ability to connect people and makers not only more affordably, but with better quality control and better service, wherever we ship.”

Cannabis Consolidation,"Global cannabis giant Tilray Brands announced amendments this week to its debt acquisition agreement with HEXO Corp, giving Tilray a 10.8% discount on the principal balance of HEXO.
In March, Tilray announced it would be taking on $211 million of debt from fellow Canadian-based cannabis producer HEXO, placing Tilray in a “significant equity ownership position.” Per the agreement, HEXO will pay Tilray an $18 million annual fee for “advisory services.” The “strategic alliance” is projected to create $80 million in “shared cost-saving synergies” for the two companies within two years, according to a press release.
The company reported that $185 million remain outstanding from HEXO’s debt, as well as accrued and unpaid interest. Through the amended agreement, Tilray will pay 89.2% of the outstanding principal balance. The agreement is expected to close July 15, although the amended agreements “extend the outside date for closing the transaction to August 1,” according to the release.
The two companies are still working on a commercial agreement, which would guarantee the production of HEXO products through Tilray (as a third party) and would require HEXO to source its cannabis products for international markets (outside U.S. and Canada) exclusively from Tilray. Tilray will also nominate two directors to HEXO’s board of directors, and one “board observer.”
“The strategic alliance with Tilray Brands accelerates HEXO’s operational turnaround and unlocks capital to expand our market leadership globally,” Charlie Bowman, HEXO’s president and CEO, said in the release. “The partnership is an essential next step in improving our capital structure, and we’re confident that the synergies realized will reset the industry.”
Tilray owns over 20 brands across 30 countries, including beverage-alcohol suppliers SweetWater Brewing, Green Flash, Alpine Beer Company, and Breckenridge Distillery. CEO Irwin Simon discussed some of Tilray’s ambitions on Brewbound Frontlines earlier this year. Watch here.

Busch Family Brewing launching new Beer,"ST. LOUIS, Missouri – Attention beer fans! The much anticipated launch of two new beers created by an heir of the Busch Family legacy is here. Busch Family Brewing & Distilling Company is proud to announce that Adolphus German Style Pilsner and Gussie Bavarian Lager are now available at select pubs and restaurants in the St. Louis area.
Adolphus Pilsner is crafted with a keen eye on the traditional German technique of decoction. Decoction is when a portion of the mash is pulled off, boiled in another vessel, and then mixed back into the mash. This process accentuates the pilsner malt character. Rather than the water cracker characteristic it typically lends to a beer, it takes on more of a bread crust aspect in addition to darkening the wort and final beer. Adolphus Pilsner is made with German noble hops which lend a gentle floral, woodsy character. A lager yeast that accentuates the malt sweetness is used and the beer is allowed to clarify naturally over time.
Gussie Bavarian is a clean and smooth lager. It boasts a balance between the deep malt flavors and the hop bitterness. Hop character is restrained herbal, spicy, floral notes. This tasty brew pairs well with foods where it can cut through spice heat or fat (i.e. hamburger, cheese). It’s an ideal accompaniment for cheese dishes, especially ones with Colby. It works well as a counter to acidic foods.
“My family and I are carrying on the tradition of brewing some of the finest beers in the country,” says Billy Busch, owner and founder, along with his family, of Busch Family Brewing and Distilling.  “As you may have guessed, Adolphus Pilsner is in honor of my great grandfather, and Gussie Pilsner is an homage to my dad.” He continues, “we’re excited about the future and are eager to introduce more brands.”
Beer lovers can now enjoy the inaugural brews at the following eateries and pubs, with more locations being added daily.

PepsiCo planning more Alcoholic drinks in the future,"PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta was asked just one question about the carbonated soft drink maker’s plans in the beverage alcohol space, during the company’s Q1 2022 earnings call Tuesday.
Asked about the launch of Hard MTN Dew in partnership with Boston Beer Company, and the company’s longer-term plans in the category, Laguarta said PepsiCo is “testing and learning at a fast speed” and “Boston Beer is learning how to market and improve the products,” as well.
“We’re also learning about how to distribute and sell low-alcohol beverages, which obviously have a lot of restrictions at the state and even municipality level,” Laguarta said of PepsiCo’s Blue Cloud Distribution branch. “We’re having to train our people in the right way and so on. So there’s a lot of test and learning, very encouraging learnings actually as we see in the consumers.”
Hard MTN Dew is “generating a lot of excitement” and garnering “a lot of initial trial,” Laguarta said. The product was initially launched in Iowa, Tennessee and Florida, followed by Arkansa, Oklahoma and Minnesota. The brand is expected to be in 15 states by the end of summer.
“As always, in these circumstances, we have to wait and see repeats and see really where the business stabilizes,” Laguarta said. “But I would say, good learnings for the organization. It’s still very early in the process of building the infrastructure and the talent base and pretty good response from the consumer.”
During Boston Beer’s Q1 earnings call last week, CEO Dave Burwick said Hard MTN Dew has received “the highest trial I’ve ever seen, ever, ever,” with a 27% share of flavored malt beverages (FMBs) in off-premise channels.
PepsiCo’s interest in bev-alc won’t stop at Hard MTN Dew, Laguarta said. He said to look for the company to “create new exciting products that will go through this platform in the future.”
“[A]s we learn more about the consumer, together with our partners, we’ll be able to innovate meaningfully in this category,” he added. “But as I said, too early, too early yet to call it a huge success.”

New Jersey craft breweries hit hard with legislative restrictions,"New Jersey craft breweries are “disheartened” after the state Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (NJABC) moved forward on July 1 with special conditions for brewery license holders that limit brewers’ ability to host food trucks and events or sell beverages not produced on site, among other privileges.
The conditions – which the Brewers Guild of New Jersey (BGNJ) described as “discouraging” and their enforcement as “extremely problematic” – went into effect in 2019, but were largely unenforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interim, the BGNJ attempted to negotiate revisions to the special ruling, but to no avail, executive director Eric Orlando wrote in a statement.
“Our organization offered several proposed changes in the last two years to regulators with the hopes that they would become part of these conditions in the interim and become the foundation of more permanent industry regulations moving forward,” he said.
“Instead, breweries in the state, still struggling from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now also impacted by record inflation and ongoing supply chain issues, will be limited in their ability this summer and the foreseeable future to serve their customers and provide the types of local, community-centric hospitality options many in our state have become accustomed to and thoroughly enjoy,” Orlando continued.
Many Garden State craft breweries operate under the state’s limited brewery license, which allows them to brew, sell and distribute up to 300,000 barrels annually, as well as sell beer directly to the public on the brewery premises. However, brewery patrons are required by law to to take a tour of the brewery in order to drink on-site. To-go sales are capped at 15.5 gallons per person. Limited license breweries cannot operate a restaurant or sell food.
Limited licensees pay a graduated annual fee based on production:
$1,250 per year for volume up to 50,000 barrels;
$2,500 per year for volume between 50,001-100,000 barrels;
$5,000 per year for volume between 100,001-200,000 barrels;
$7,500 per year for volume between 200,001-300,000 barrels.
The limited brewery license took its current shape in 2012, before the taproom business model boom transformed craft breweries into destinations for on-premise consumption. NJABC observed that “the activities and practice of the limited breweries vary across the state and, in some instances, exceed the privileges of the limited brewery license.” In an attempt to balance the concerns of breweries and other licensed on- and off-premise retailers, NJABC issued special considerations on brewery licenses in the fall of 2018, but walked them back after what it called “a media controversy.”
NJABC took the next few months to consult with the state’s two brewers guilds (the BGNJ and the New Jersey Brewers Association), the New Jersey Licensed Beverage Association, the New Jersey Restaurant Association, the New Jersey Liquor Store Alliance and state legislators. That “informal fact finding” led to the creation of the 2019 conditions, which NJABC credited to “the plain language” of the statute that created limited brewery licenses and a “review of its legislative history.”
“The division cannot escape its original interpretation that the 2012 amendments to the limited brewery statute were enacted for the purpose of promoting the manufacture of craft beers and creating a demand for these products through limited consumption privileges on the brewery premises,” NJABC wrote.
Rather, NJABC envisioned that consumption in taprooms with limited brewery licenses would lead to a beer-enthusiastic public that would seek out beers from local breweries at on-premise retailers. It developed the 2019 conditions to create a taproom culture that would serve as a stepping stone instead of a final destination.
“The division believes the activities permitted under the 2019 special ruling strike a fair and appropriate balance between the interests of full retail license holders, such as restaurants and bars, and the craft brewing industry,” an NJABC spokesperson told Brewbound, adding that the division seeks to “work with all licensees to promote a fair and robust alcoholic beverage industry in New Jersey.”
However, the discrepancy between the nature of the licenses that breweries can obtain and those that on- and off-premise retailers need has created tension between the two groups.
“We have a very restrictive liquor license system and our liquor laws were created basically in the Prohibition era,” Scott Wells, director of sales at Carlstadt-based Bolero Snort and BGNJ board member, told Brewbound. “The availability of liquor licenses is tied back to the population of each municipality. Municipalities choose to not issue the full amount of licenses that they’re entitled to. Most of the licenses have been in families for generations, and the resale value on them at this point has reached $1 million to $2 million.”
By comparison, limited brewery licenses are manufacturing licenses given by the state and are not limited by population.
Bolero Snort sells about 95% of its volume through the three-tier distribution system. The brewery self-distributes within New Jersey and also ships to New York City (SKI), Massachusetts (Craft Collective), Pennsylvania (31st and Wharton) and Georgia (Modern Hops), according to its website. But, unlike Bolero Snort, some Garden State breweries do nearly all of their business over their own bars. A perception persists among retailers that most craft breweries with taprooms are competition instead of suppliers, which “creates an us versus them mentality,” Wells said.
“In other parts of the state, the bar owners aren’t buying beer the customers want,” he said. “They complain about ‘Oh, the brewery down the road stole my customers.’ Yeah, but you’re not offering your customers any local craft beer options. You’ve got the same distribution stuff on that you’ve had for the past 100 years and you won’t even take a meeting with the local guys. What do you expect the customers to do?”
So as not to funnel business away from restaurants and into taprooms, limited brewery license holders are “explicitly prohibited from selling food or operating a restaurant,” according to the 2019 conditions. This prohibition extends to inviting food trucks or pop-up vendors to set up on brewery grounds, which is particularly vexing to Wells.
“It’s really the most insulting thing on the list of conditions,” he said, adding that servers are required to become certified through TIPS (Training for Intervention ProcedureS) or a similar program, the training process for which is “three-and-a-half hours of ‘feed them, feed them, feed them, feed them, feed them.’”
Under their licenses, breweries are limited to 25 “on-premises special events” – roughly two per month – which NJABC defines as:
“Trivia/quizzo/game night;
Arts and crafts/paint and sip;
Live music/DJs/open microphone;
Games of skill;
Educational events and seminars;
Political fundraisers that are not organized by a not-for-profit, as defined in N.J.A.C. 12:2-5.1(a);
Movie or theatrical events;
Animal adoption events, to the extent permitted by local ordinance; or
Yoga or other similar types of classes.”
To host an event, breweries must notify NJABC 10 days in advance and must include:
“Description of special event to occur on licensed premises;
Date and time of event;
Estimated number of people in attendance;
Cover charge for event, if any;
Security for event to ensure no consumption by individuals under the legal age and no pass-offs; and
Name, address, and other contact information for outside vendor providing entertainment if any; and
Statement indicated that this is the [number] on-premises special event held on the licensed premises in the present calendar year.”
If breweries are selling event tickets, the “cover charge shall not include any free or discounted alcoholic beverages, and participants shall not be required to purchase any number of alcoholic beverages as a condition entry,” the conditions read.
“The new conditions have severely limited what we can do in our spectacular brewery with no true rhyme or reason to what is actually trying to be accomplished,” Jeremy Lees, president of Flounder Brewing in Hillsborough, told Brewbound.
Flounder, which moved into its current location – a 250-year-old repurposed Dutch barn – last summer, has found success with yoga classes and a meet-the-brewer session, but has decided to abandon both event series in light of the conditions.
“We can no longer host a small yoga start-up on a Sunday morning at 11 a.m., who found our venue perfect for her yoga class, as these count against our 25 ‘live events’ per year and yoga isn’t at the top of the list for us to utilize the 25,” Lees said. “We can no longer conduct our Brewer’s Hour, which was an hour on a Sunday where customers could pay to receive two beers and hear our brewer talk about the intent behind the beers and provide beer education.
“The conditions do not allow us to sell a ticket that includes beer and an event such as this would also count against our 25,” he continued. “We just don’t have enough live events available.”
The conditions also cap the number of private events breweries can host to 52, which translates to one per week, something that has been particularly limiting for Flounder since the opening of its new space.
“Many people want to host private parties or weddings at [our] beautiful setting, but we can only host 52 private events per year so these conditions even limit the amount of private functions we can use our space for,” Lees said. “Our brewery has become a tourist attraction in our county and brings visitors from hours away and we work together with our local and county tourism boards to work on ways to bring those visitors to other places in the area once they are with us.
“Everything about the special ruling and conditions is counteractive to what craft beer has proven all across the country — a valuable asset to tourism, economic development and positive impacts on all types of local establishments,” he continued.
For a state with more than 9 million residents, New Jersey’s craft beer industry lags behind states of similar size in several metrics tracked by the Brewers Association (BA), the trade group representing the country’s small and independent craft brewers. New Jersey’s 141 craft breweries amount to two breweries per capita (per 100,000 legal-drinking-age adults), ranking 45th nationwide. Last year, those breweries produced 213,656 barrels of beer, about one gallon per LDA adult, ranking 46th nationwide.
The BGNJ, which Wells estimated represents about one-third of the state’s breweries, has called on Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration to “recognize the need for reform in the wake of the pandemic to keep our local beer industry growing.”
“We hope forthcoming regulations issued by NJABC later this year utilize our recommendations for the good of the dozens of small businesses which make up the state’s craft beer industry,” Orlando wrote on behalf of the guild. “While we understand the NJABC is only empowered to enforce the laws as written, our guild believes the imposition of these broad conditions at this juncture by the division is extremely problematic and need[s] to be remedied.”

Bang Energy files motion to vacate fine,"Bang Energy maker Vital Pharmaceuticals’ motion to vacate a $175 million arbitration award was denied last week, clearing the way for Orange Bang and Monster Energy Company to collect damages plus a 5% royalty on all future net sales of Bang-branded products.
The award — in addition to nearly $10 million in attorney’s fees and costs — had been granted in April after family-owned beverage maker Orange Bang and Monster Energy Company successfully argued to an arbitrator that VPX was liable for breach of contract and trademark infringement by falsely claiming its products contain creatine.
The case stems from a 2009 trademark infringement filed by Orange Bang against VPX, which had granted it permission to use the Bang trademark on creatine-based products or other beverages that are marketed exclusively in vitamin and supplement channels.
Speaking at BevNET Live Summer 2022 last month, Bang’s outspoken CEO Jack Owoc dismissed the ruling as “the false ruling of a rogue arbitrator who has no background in science.”
“Never sign a contract that has arbitration, because it’s a circumvention of the legal system,” he said. “Don’t sign it. Go to court. Due process.”
In his June 30 decision confirming the arbitration award, Judge Dale S. Fischer wrote, “The arbitrator in this case appears to have taken great care with both the factual issues and the law.”
“In short, there is no basis to find that the award was ‘completely irrational’ or that the arbitrator engaged in ‘manifest disregard of the law,’” he wrote. “At most, Plaintiffs’ arguments suggest that the arbitrator may have been incorrect in his rulings, but that falls far short of the standard for vacating an arbitration award.”
Owoc did not respond to a request for comment.

New American Whiskey Brands,"Pernod Ricard announced last week the launch of The American Whiskey Collective, a new business unit dedicated to the company’s American whiskey portfolio that will pursue growth by investing in the “new fashioned” brands’ innovation, according to the division’s newly appointed head, Craig Johnson.
“When you look at American whiskey brands, one of the tried and true formulas [for growth] is through innovation,” said Johnson.
While the French company owns powerhouse Irish and Scotch whiskeys like Jameson and Ballentine’s, Pernod Ricard’s state-side focus is on premium, non-traditional challenger brands. Rabbit Hole, acquired in 2019, is known for distinct grain mixes and limited edition releases. Lesser known spirits like Smooth Ambler and TX Whiskeys joined the portfolio in 2016 and 2019, respectively. And since its acquisition of Jefferson’s Bourbon three years ago, growth of the brand has more than doubled, according to Johnson. Part of that success can be attributed to Jefferson’s forward-thinking founder, Trey Zoeller, whose experiments in aging include Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea Rye.

“Our brands are kind of non-traditional American whiskeys and we’re really proud of that,” he said. “The consumers of American whiskeys look to get unique products, whether it’s unique recipes like Rabbit Hole has or unique aging like Jefferson’s Ocean.”
American whiskey sales are expected to account for a significant amount of Pernod Ricard USA’s total volumes within the next five to 10 years. The category has been enjoying a resurgence recently —and different processes, flavors and aging techniques are part of the increased interest, according to Drizly BevAlc Insights. American whiskey volume has been accelerating over the last decade, growing from 16 million nine-liter cases in 2011 to 29.7 million in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.
An interest in local products could also be giving distillers a boost, especially as whiskey production has expanded out from traditional regions. Smooth Ambler is distilled in West Virginia and TX is made near Fort Worth, Texas.
“There is that macro trend of people wanting local products. They want products from the U.S., but they also want craft and high quality products,” said Johnson.
The collective will build on the models of two similar divisions, the Gin Hub and House of Tequila, that boost smaller brands with operations and marketing support.
“The focus and the attention that these new business units can bring to categories can be a real driver of the business and a real strength,” he said.

Expect to see new offerings similar to Rabbit Hole’s limited edition releases and a TX-branded ready-to-drink product that recently launched in Texas. Advertising support will also be a priority: Johnson and the team are considering nontraditional media approaches that have been effective in previous campaigns, such as its 13-minute documentary on Jefferson’s founder. Expect some celebrity presence too— TX recently teamed up with actor Scott McNairy for a series of spots aimed at millennial drinkers and highlighting its roots as a uniquely Texas brand.
Establishing a consolidated global footprint is also a priority, starting with Western Europe and Asia. American whiskey exports have enjoyed growth as of late, with annual sales now exceeding 20 million cases. Pernod Ricard itself saw global sales surge by double digits in the first half of fiscal year 2022, with organic growth up 17%, thanks to the strength of the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan, according to the company’s latest earnings report.

With the opportunity clear, the French spirits conglomerate will support The American Whiskey Collective with the “infrastructure, marketing investment levels and innovation support” that match its “ambitious performance goals.” That will be the task ahead for division leaders Johnson, a member of Pernod Ricard USA’s executive team and an 18-year company veteran, and Jessica Chen, vice president of operations for American whiskies.
“We feel that we can start with global growth because we’re in a place that from an operations standpoint we can help fund global growth behind these brands now, and we’re in a place from a supply chain standpoint that we can deliver,” said Johnson.

Sustainability results in Profits from top Ten Beverage Distribution,"Top-ten beverage distributor engages industry-leading sustainability firm to reduce costs and greenhouse gas emissions throughout its operations.
Double Green, a provider of sustainable solutions that reduce costs and carbon emissions, announced that Crescent Crown Distributing is leveraging Double Green’s expertise to meet its sustainability goals, reduce costs and make the business and its facilities more resilient.
Sustainability is not a new endeavor for Crescent Crown, with operations in Arizona and Louisiana. Since 2012, the beer, spirits, and non-alcoholic beverage distributor has been running its Arizona warehouse operations through its own rooftop solar power system, and added almost 100% more solar capacity through a carport system installed in 2020.
“We’re proud of our results in reducing our environmental impact from our investments over the years. We are committed to being a national leader in everything that we do. By partnering with Double Green, we’ll have a roadmap for continuous sustainable improvement to quantifiably reduce our environmental impact and that of the brands we represent,”  said James R. Moffett, President of Crescent Crown Distributing.
Molly Reilly, President of Double Green, said, “Crescent Crown is known as a sustainable leader in the beer and beverage and logistics industry. We’re thrilled to support their goals of delivering a truly sustainable plan measuring and communicating their financial and environmental savings.”
Neil Baier, Vice President of Finance for Crescent Crown Distributing, said, “We’ve seen the financial value in our Arizona renewable energy investments, and with Double Green’s help, we are certain we will find even greater savings.”
“We’re committed to sustainability and continuous improvement, but we can’t lose our focus on doing what we do best, selling and delivering our supplier’s beverages to retail,” said Baier. “I am therefore really excited to have Double Green do the heavy lifting, evaluating the solutions and quantifying the returns to support our business goals to ensure our facilities have long-term sustainability.”

AB Passes on acquiring craft Brewing Alliance,"The deadline for Anheuser-Busch InBev to make a qualifying offer to acquire the remaining stake of Craft Brew Alliance (CBA) came and went today without an offer.
The world’s largest beer manufacturer, which already owns 31.3 percent of the smaller Portland, Oregon-headquartered craft beer maker, had until today, August 23, to either make an offer for the remaining stake in the company at a minimum of $24.50 per share (about $328 million) or pay a $20 million fee.
Ultimately, A-B decided to pay a one-time $20 million fee to CBA, whose brands include Kona Brewing, Widmer Brothers, Redhook, Omission, Square Mile Cider, Wynwood Brewing, Cisco Brewers and Appalachian Mountain Brewery, as well as the pH Experiment.
In a statement, A-B Brewers Collective president Marcelo “Mika” Michaelis said:
“The long-standing and strong partnership we have with Craft Brew Alliance (CBA) is extremely valuable to Anheuser-Busch. While we are not making an offer to purchase the remaining shares of CBA, our existing commercial partnership with CBA continues to be a key complement to our industry-leading craft portfolio and we look forward to working together for many years to come.”
In a separate statement, Andy Thomas, CEO of CBA, called A-B’s decision “disappointing” but said with the company’s immediate ownership situation now clear, “management can turn its attention to refining strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.”
“Over the past several years, we have built a sustainable infrastructure, optimized our footprint, and amassed a diversified portfolio of brands to support future profitable growth anchored by robust growth in the Kona brand and the addition of our three newly acquired brands,” he said. “Looking to the future, we are optimistic that our healthy balance sheet, bolstered by the $20 million payment, and strategic investments in innovation and increased brand awareness will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more details of our growth plan in the coming weeks.”
Still, more questions remain than answers. Chief among them, why did A-B pass on the opportunity to acquire CBA and its fast-growing Kona Brewing brand, which is on pace to be a 500,000-barrel brand by year end? And, moving forward, what is A-B’s interest in the company?
Due to the size of CBA, such a transaction would have necessitated review and approval by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
The prospect of a qualifying offer had hung over CBA in recent years, and a transaction seemed to make sense as CBA’s route to market is closely aligned with A-B through brewing, distribution and export contracts. However, those deals will remain in place for up to another seven years, at CBA’s election, including a Master Distributor Agreement (MDA) to leverage A-B’s wholesaler network at $0.25 per case through 2028, the ability to contract brew up to 300,000 barrels at A-B’s production facilities at a savings of $10 per barrel; and export opportunities through A-B subsidiaries.
Without the spectre of an A-B offer, CBA is now free to explore other options unencumbered, including a potential sale to another buyer.
Following CBA’s Q2 earnings report earlier this month, Thomas told Brewbound that there are “an infinite number of possibilities” for CBA in the event an A-B never materialized. Nevertheless, A-B will still have a say in any potential deal, holding two seats on CBA’s eight-member board.
CBA now reaps $20 million to use as it sees fit. In a “Quick Take” report today, Cowen managing director for beverages, cannabis and tobacco Vivien Azer suggested CBA could use that windfall to restructure its business, pay down debt, repurchase shares, or invest behind Kona and new innovations in the “beyond beer” space.
A-B passing on an outright acquisition of CBA comes just weeks after the company announced a deal for Cleveland, Ohio-based Platform Beer Co., the company’s first craft acquisition since purchasing North Carolina’s Wicked Weed in 2017.
CBA will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 5, to give an update on its business strategy moving forward, as well as full-year 2019 financial projections.
