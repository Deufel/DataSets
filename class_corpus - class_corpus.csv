Shutdown-Unity.docx,"President Donald Trump said Republicans ""are totally unified"" behind his border wall fight.

The president met with the Senate GOP caucus as a few senators have started to break with their party in Trump's immigration battle. Trump and senators emerged preaching consensus, which does not bode well for the shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats hold firm on their pledge not to fund the proposed barrier.

""We're all behind the president. We think this border security issue is extremely important to the country,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters after the meeting.

No deal to reopen nine federal departments appeared to take shape. As the stalemate continues, Trump is set to meet with bipartisan congressional leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

The Democratic-held House has passed legislation to fund the government without money for the proposed wall. McConnell has said the Republican-controlled Senate will not take up the measures because Trump opposes them.

One House-passed proposal would fund all remaining departments other than Homeland Security through Sept. 30. A separate bill would reopen DHS through Feb. 8, giving lawmakers time to reach an agreement on border security while allowing workers at other departments to get paid.

Republicans have started to support funding the agencies except Homeland Security, leading to questions about whether pressure on McConnell and Trump will grow. 

Murkowski told reporters that she urged Trump to take her position on government funding during the Senate GOP meeting. Trump responded by saying senators should stay unified, Murkowski said.

Trump has said the shutdown could last for ""months or even years"" if he does not secure money for the wall. 

As the shutdown dragged on Wednesday, Democrats aimed to highlight the federal workers who could soon miss paychecks because of the spat. Standing with furloughed federal workers at the Capitol, Pelosi said the president ""has chosen a wall over workers.""

Their message contrasted with rhetoric from Trump, who described the U.S.-Mexico border as a ""humanitarian crisis"" and used grisly tales to call for an immigration crackdown during a televised Oval Office address Tuesday night.

Trump has downplayed the shutdown's effect on government employees. At the White House on Wednesday, he said the workers ""are terrific patriots and a lot of them agree with what I'm doing.""

""So many of those people are saying, 'It's so hard for me, it's very hard for my family, but Mr. President, you're doing the right thing,'"" Trump claimed.

A top union representative who spoke at the event with Pelosi and Schumer on Wednesday disagreed. U.S. employees are ""absolutely, completely and without reservation opposed to this government shutdown lockout,"" said J. David Cox, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

Trump teased the possibility of declaring a national emergency at the border to build the wall — which he ultimately did not do during his remarks Tuesday. The president said Wednesday that the ""threshold"" for him taking that step is failure to reach a border security deal with lawmakers."
CJR_Doc2_Impeachment-Foreign-Influence.docx,"Alexander Hamilton, as usual, got right to the heart of the matter. When the framers were designing the Constitution and its power of impeachment, one of the high crimes they had in mind was giving into what Hamilton called “the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.”



For the authors of the country’s charter, there were few bigger threats than a president corruptly tied to forces from overseas. And so as the House opened an impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s interactions with Ukraine this past week, the debate quickly focused on one of the oldest issues in America’s democratic experiment.



The emerging battle over the future of Mr. Trump’s presidency will explore as never before the scope and limits of a commander in chief’s interactions with other countries. His adversaries echo the fears of the founders in accusing Mr. Trump of committing high crimes by pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on Democratic opponents while holding up American aid. Mr. Trump contends that impeaching him would infringe on the ability of future presidents to conduct foreign policy.



Unlike the impeachment battles involving Andrew Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, the debate over Mr. Trump turns on whether a president can solicit or accept help from abroad to advance his political fortunes and where lies the line between the national interest and personal interests.



Shortly after the latest revelations about Mr. Trump’s pressure on Ukraine, Senator Christopher Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, denounced what he called “the president’s corrupt efforts to press a foreign nation into the service of his re-election campaign.”



“To use America’s global credibility as a casino token, to be cashed in for personal political gain,” he added, “is an intolerable abuse of power and totally anathema to the rule of law.”



Mr. Trump has maintained that he was the one trying to stop illicit foreign involvement in American politics by pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to examine whether Ukrainians helped Democrats during the 2016 campaign and to look into unsubstantiated corruption allegations involving former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.



“If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!” he wrote on Twitter on Friday.



While the framers of the Constitution might never have imagined an impeachment battle waged 280 characters at a time, they did essentially foresee a showdown over foreign influence on an American president. In fact, in the early years of the republic, one of the most dominant fears of the political class was falling under the sway of other powers.





The framers expressed this explicitly by inserting what is now called the emoluments clause in the Constitution, barring international payments or gifts to a president or other federal elected official: “No person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.”"
ER_Doc2_Trump Administration-Trade Agreement-Japan.docx,"America announces a limited trade agreement with Japan


The deal shows how hard it is for the Trump administration to rewrite the rules of world trade

President Donald Trump teased trade-watchers on September 25th when he reannounced a deal with Japan (just weeks after announcing an agreement in principle). He promised it would mean “really big dollars for our farmers and for our ranchers”. A White House press release boasted about the extra access American exporters of beef, pork and cheese would get to the Japanese market. Robert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, told journalists that American tariff reductions would arrive by January 1st. But despite all the fanfare, the text of the deal remained unpublished.

There had been hopes that Mr Trump might sign a mini-deal with India, too, during his meeting with the country’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on September 24th. American companies complain that India’s price controls on heart stents and knee implants force them to sell at below cost price. The hope was that, in return for a package that solved that problem, India might be reinstated as a member of America’s Generalised System of Preferences, which offers lower tariffs on some products. But negotiators failed to resolve their differences in time.

The mismatch between the demand for photo opportunities and the supply of worked-out trade deals explains both anticlimaxes. Such agreements are complex legal documents, and the language needs to be clear enough that neither side can squeeze out more concessions on the sly. This is trickier when neither trusts the other. The deal with Japan was as difficult as any other, even though the negotiators had relatively recently sealed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (tpp), an agreement including America and Japan negotiated by the Obama administration, only to be rejected by Mr Trump.

Despite the lack of detail, one thing is clear: the deal will be narrow. Apart from some rules on digital trade, it seems to be focused on tariff barriers. It omits cars and car parts, even though these account for around two-fifths of Japanese goods exports to America. This has drawn criticism. Myron Brilliant of the us Chamber of Commerce, a lobby group, described the agreement as “not enough”.

The narrow scope is partly because the Trump administration wants to avoid having to seek full congressional approval. (American trade law allows small tariff concessions to be made without it.) But it raises questions about whether the agreement complies with the rules of the World Trade Organisation, which say deals must include “substantially all the trade” if they are to withstand legal challenge.

The wto does permit smaller interim agreements—and, mirabile dictu, that is how the Trump administration describes this one. The leaders’ joint statement said that within four months of the mini-deal coming into force, the two countries hope to finish consultations and “thereafter” start negotiating a deal that would address issues including barriers to trade in services and investment."
Trump-Plans-to.docx,"For the second time in a month, President Donald Trump is reportedly set to make a controversial nomination to the Federal Reserve Board.

Trump is reportedly waiting until Cain’s background check is complete to make an official announcement. That may end up complicating matters, as Cain has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least four women — allegations that, along with revelations of a long-term extramarital affair, prompted him to end his presidential campaign in December 2011.

Trump — who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women — defended Cain when the allegations against Cain were in the news in late 2011, telling Fox News at the time that his accusers “probably do love their names splashed across the front pages. … I think Herman should take very, very strong action, even if he has to bring a major lawsuit against the women.”

News that Trump plans to nominate Cain comes less than a month after he announced that he plans to fill another opening on the board with Stephen Moore, an economic commentator who is perhaps best known for playing a staunch Trump loyalist on CNN.

Cain, like Moore, has close ties to Trump. Last September, Cain co-founded a pro-Trump Super PAC, America Fighting Back PAC. Its homepage features a photo of Trump with the text, “We must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment.”

Cain is actually more qualified for the job than Moore. From 1992 to 1996, he served as director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

As far as economic policy goes, Cain is perhaps best known for his “9-9-9” tax proposal, which would’ve replaced the US tax system with a flat tax of 9 percent on businesses, personal income, and sales.

Cain has recently spoken out against the Fed interest rate increases

News that Trump plans to nominate Cain came hours after Trump posted his latest tweet criticizing the Fed for the interest rate hikes it implemented during his first two years in office.

Though the Fed announced last month that rates would hold steady for now, Trump is apparently still unhappy with Chair Jerome Powell. Axios reports that Trump regards his selection of Powell “as one of the greatest mistakes of his administration. He has told aides that Powell has no ‘feel’ for the markets and compares him to a golfer who cannot putt.”

As late as December 2017, Cain publicly said he regarded the Fed’s policy of gradual rate hikes as “good news.” But he’s since brought his view into alignment with Trump, as Bloomberg detailed in a January report that broke news about Cain being under consideration for a Fed seat

He told Bloomberg News in an interview that he’s concerned the Fed was overly aggressive with interest rate increases in the last year, but didn’t respond to follow-up questions about his column defending higher rates.

The chain of events is reminiscent of what happened about a year ago with Ronny Jackson, Trump’s former White House physician and onetime choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Shortly after Trump announced Jackson as his pick to lead the VA, reports emerged about him drinking on the job and mistreating staff. Jackson’s nomination was eventually pulled. More recently, in February, Trump’s pick for United Nations ambassador, Heather Nauert, withdrew from consideration for the job amid reports that she employed a nanny who was in the country legally but didn’t have a proper work permit."
Manafort-Share-Russian.docx,"As a top official in President Trump’s campaign, Paul Manafort shared political polling data with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday. The document provided the clearest evidence to date that the Trump campaign may have tried to coordinate with Russians during the 2016 presidential race.

Mr. Manafort’s lawyers made the disclosure by accident, through a formatting error in a document filed to respond to charges that he had lied to prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after agreeing to cooperate with their investigation into Russian interference in the election.

The document also revealed that during the campaign, Mr. Manafort and his Russian associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, discussed a plan for peace in Ukraine. Throughout the campaign and the early days of the Trump administration, Russia and its allies were pushing various plans for Ukraine in the hope of gaining relief from American-led sanctions imposed after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine.

Prosecutors and the news media have already documented a string of encounters between Russian operatives and Trump campaign associates dating from the early months of Mr. Trump’s bid for the presidency, including the now-famous meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan with a Russian lawyer promising damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The accidental disclosure appeared to some experts to be perhaps most damning of all.

The document gave no indication of whether Mr. Trump was aware of the data transfer or how Mr. Kilimnik might have used the information. But from March to August 2016, when Mr. Manafort worked for the Trump campaign, Russia was engaged in a full-fledged operation using social media, stolen emails and other tactics to boost Mr. Trump, attack Mrs. Clinton and play on divisive issues such as race and guns. Polling data could conceivably have helped Russia hone those messages and target audiences to help swing votes to Mr. Trump.

Both Mr. Manafort and Rick Gates, the deputy campaign manager, transferred the data to Mr. Kilimnik in the spring of 2016 as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, according to a person knowledgeable about the situation. Most of the data was public, but some of it was developed by a private polling firm working for the campaign, according to the person.

Mr. Manafort asked Mr. Gates to tell Mr. Kilimnik to pass the data to Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who is close to the Kremlin and who has claimed that Mr. Manafort owed him money from a failed business venture, the person said. It is unclear whether Mr. Manafort was acting at the campaign’s behest or independently, trying to gain favor with someone to whom he was deeply in debt.

Of the various Russian intermediaries to the Trump campaign, Mr. Kilimnik appears to be one of the most important to Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. A Russian citizen and resident, he faces charges from Mr. Mueller’s team of tampering with witnesses who had information about Mr. Manafort, but Mr. Kilimnik is not expected to ever stand trial."
Migrant_crisis .docx,"The crisis on the southern border has been driven by a surge of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Now there's a new face of the crisis: Hundreds of African migrants have crossed the border in recent weeks, many to seek asylum.

Border Patrol agents in the Del Rio sector of South Texas recently took into custody more than 500 migrants in just one week, mostly families from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Angola.

""The migrant crisis at the U.S. border has been so well-publicized, and because of all the chaos over policymaking in Washington, D.C., it really gives the impression that the U.S. border is open for business right now,"" says Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank.

Capps says Central Africans are also drawn to the U.S. because Europe is not so open for business, and because the boat trip across the Mediterranean can be treacherous. In fact, Capps says, many don't even make it to the sea. They're in refugee camps in North Africa.

""Many of them are stuck and languishing in really poor conditions, some in near slave conditions in Libya right now,"" Capps says. ""So when conditions at home are desperate, and the Europe option doesn't look good, the high-priced, long-distance option to come to the U.S. might be worth it.""

First, many of these migrants fly to South America. And when they get there, they find well-traveled roads to follow north, Capps says.

Capps says the U.S. can expect more migrants from all over the world to seek asylum in the United States unless Mexico does more to stop them. After threatening to impose tariffs, President Trump recently gave Mexico 45 days to act. Mexico pledged to beef up security on its southern border.

Many of the African asylum-seekers have then made their way to cities like Portland, Maine, with large, established African immigrant communities. And just as the surge of migrants is overwhelming border agents and the nation's immigration court system, it is also taxing social services from Portland to San Antonio, Texas.

At a recent press conference, Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling called this current wave of families seeking asylum ""our future.""

""We need to do everything we can to make sure that when they arrive, they are stable,"" he says. ""And that they, as quickly as possible, are able to get on their feet and start supporting their families and contributing to our economy.""

But the influx has stressed the city, which didn't have enough room in shelters to house the many newcomers who arrived last week. The makeshift emergency shelter at the arena now houses more than 200 asylum-seekers.

At the shelter, volunteers offer food and health supplies to the migrants. Some translate and build arts and crafts projects with the young children.

Immigrant communities and advocacy groups have worked with the city to volunteer and get supplies to the newcomers — everything from diapers to snacks. And donations have poured in to a city-run fundraiser — $350,000 so far.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills says that these migrants have endured brutality and bloodshed, and the people of Maine have a ""proud tradition"" of caring for their neighbors."
Trump-says-DHS.docx,"Senior administration officials told CNN that Nielsen had a 5 p.m., meeting at the White House with Trump where she was planning to discuss with him the immigration and border issues and a path forward. She had no intention of resigning, according to one of the sources, but rather was going there with an agenda.

The source notes Trump's frustration with the current asylum laws, and his desire for individuals who work for the administration to just stop Central American asylum seekers from entering the United States, contrary to the law.

Nielsen has felt ""in limbo"" for the last week, a person close to her says, as she bore the brunt of the President's anger over the border.

She's been increasingly on thin ice in the eyes of the President. She did not realize how dire it was when she left the US last weekend, but quickly did, as she abruptly returned.

She did interviews -- including on CNN -- to try and improve the President's souring view of her, the source close to Nielsen said, but to little avail.

""Nothing she could do or say could change how the President started viewing her,"" the source close to Nielsen said.

That said, she was prepared to be fired at any moment, but did not know going into Sunday's meeting it would be imminent.

The departure comes just days after Trump suddenly withdrew the nomination of Ron Vitiello for Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, blindsiding the Department of Homeland Security and the Hill. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination had been pulled, a person familiar with the news said. The announcement Sunday also follows plans to cut aid to some Central American countries, marking a sudden reversal after Nielsen had days earlier visited Honduras to sign a regional compact agreement with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

Nielsen has had a tumultuous tenure that saw Trump steadily ramping up pressure on his team to execute his immigration promises, which he believes is the single driving issue for his base of political supporters.

Trump has vented privately that Nielsen hasn't adequately secured the border or enacted stricter immigration rules, even as she became the face of policies that administration critics called heartless and illegal.

In recent weeks, administration officials have been sounding the alarm over the increase in migrants at the southern border, underscoring the change in demographics as one of the reasons for the host of challenges they're facing.

""Right now, we have an emergency on our hands. We need to treat it as such,"" Nielsen told Chris Cuomo on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" Thursday.

When Kelly moved to the West Wing as chief of staff, Nielsen followed, becoming a deputy chief of staff tasked with helping Kelly bring rigor to a freewheeling staff.

The role didn't gain her popularity, but it helped her gain enough of Trump's trust to elevate her to the Cabinet post.

But at the agency that oversees border protection and immigration matters -- Trump's signature issue -- it was inevitable Nielsen would find herself in the President's crosshairs.

After a previous Cabinet meeting during which Trump berated her for not acting strongly enough on preventing illegal immigration, Nielsen considered resigning, people familiar with the matter said at the time.

She didn't then, and went on to become one of the public faces of a controversial policy that separated families at the southern border."
Trump Says U.S. ‘Winning’ Trade War After Reviving China Talks.docx,"President Donald Trump declared the U.S. was “winning” the trade war a day after reaching a temporary truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping.



On a visit to South Korea following the Group of 20 summit in Japan, Trump said at a news conference that the Federal Reserve “has not been of help to us at all” in his trade spat with Beijing.



“Despite that, we’re winning, and we’re winning big because we have created an economy that is second to none,” he said.



The White House has yet to reveal details of Trump’s arrangement with Xi, leaving uncertainty about how the two countries will proceed. Trump said after the G-20 meeting that he would hold off indefinitely on tariffs planned for an additional $300 billion in Chinese imports while allowing U.S. companies to continue to do some business with China’s Huawei Technologies Co., one of the country’s most prominent firms.



‘Catastrophic Mistake’

The move drew criticism back home, where many members of Congress agreed with the administration’s assessment that Huawei is a threat to national security and don’t want the company treated as a bargaining chip. The Commerce Department in May moved to place Huawei on a blacklist that would cut it off from American suppliers.



U.S. officials have alleged the company’s products could be utilized for espionage by Beijing, a claim Huawei denies.

“If President Trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against #Huawei he has made a catastrophic mistake,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said in a tweet.



In addition to agreeing to re-start talks, Trump said Xi had also agreed that China would buy large amounts of U.S. agricultural goods. But Chinese official media reports said only that Trump hopes China will import more American goods as part of the trade-war truce.

Trump offered no further visibility into his agreement with Xi during both a scheduled meeting on Sunday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and a surprise summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Demilitarized Zone dividing the Korean Peninsula.

“We are where we are,” he said at a news conference with Moon when asked about China. “We’re collecting 25 percent on $250 billion, and China is paying for it, as you know, because, as you notice, our inflation hasn’t gone up.”



Yuan Devaluation

The president has repeatedly insisted that China bears the cost of the tariffs he’s imposed on its exports to the U.S., rejecting the consensus of economists that the taxes are paid by American companies and consumers in the form of higher prices.

“China has devalued their currency in order to pay for the tariffs,” he said. The yuan has declined against the dollar in the last year, helping offset some of the impact of Trump’s tariffs, but Chinese officials have said the devaluation is the result of market forces.

The U.S. Treasury Department under Trump has refrained from accusing China of artificially manipulating its currency.



“And in addition to devaluing, they’ve also pumped a lot of money into their economic model,” Trump said. “They’ve been pumping money in. We haven’t. We’ve been retracting. We’ve been raising interest rates and they’ve been lowering interest rates.”

Trump frequently complains about the Federal Reserve and its chairman he appointed, Jerome Powell, for raising interest rates in 2018. The central bank indicated after policy meetings earlier this month that it may consider reducing rates later this year if the economy softens."
Shutdown2.docx,"The Trump administration on Tuesday said it has called back tens of thousands of federal workers to fulfill key government tasks, including disbursing tax refunds, overseeing flight safety and inspecting the nation’s food and drug supply, as it seeks to blunt the impact of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

The nearly 50,000 furloughed federal employees are being brought back to work without pay — part of a group of about 800,000 federal workers who are not receiving paychecks during the shutdown, which is affecting dozens of federal agencies large and small. A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a bid by unions representing air traffic controllers and other federal workers to force the government to pay them if they are required to work.

The efforts by the Trump administration to keep the government operating during the partial shutdown came as the White House and Congress made no progress toward resolving their underlying dispute.

President Trump extended an unusual lunch invitation to a handful of rank-and-file House Democrats in an attempt to woo them and create a divide within the Democratic camp over the shutdown. But the lawmakers rebuffed the outreach as Democratic leaders voiced concerns the meeting would prove little more than a photo opportunity bolstering Trump.

With Democrats in the House pushing forward with bills to reopen the government, Trump seesawing from one strategy to another to win funding for his border wall and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) largely sitting out the battle, there appeared to be no path toward opening the government as the partial shutdown ground through its 25th day.

The differing developments left a discordant image of Washington. As political leaders were paralyzed over a way to end the impasse, the federal government itself was looking for ways to show flexibility in determining who can and cannot work.

The president struck a defiant tone in a call Tuesday afternoon with supporters, according to audio of the call obtained by The Washington Post, urging them to call Democrats and voice support for the border wall and pledging, “We’re going to win.”

 

“They’re not being paid right now because of the Democrats,” Trump said of the federal workforce.

“People are impressed with how well government is working with the circumstances we’re under,” the president added.

But lawmakers from both parties were getting increasingly anxious for the shutdown to be over, even as an endgame looked as remote as ever.

The contours of the standoff have not changed since the shutdown began Dec. 22, with Trump repeating his demands for $5.7 billion to build more than 200 new miles of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border and Democrats refusing to budge from offering $1.3 billion to extend existing funding levels for border barriers and fencing.

Democrats are calling on Trump to reopen the portions of the government that have nothing to do with the wall before they negotiate with him on that issue. Trump has refused, but increasing numbers of Republicans have been issuing calls for Trump to reopen the government, even if just on a short-term basis as negotiations continue."
DP_Doc1_Trump-Bolton-Tenure.docx,"Trump Abruptly Ends John Bolton's Unlikely Tenure as NSA

Bolton’s embattled tenure in what has become a tumultuous position in the Trump White House has come to an end.



PRESIDENT Donald Trump on Tuesday announced he had fired national security adviser John Bolton, ending what some considered the unlikely tenure of one of the Republican establishment's most emphatic hawks on Venezuela, Iran and North Korea.

In a series of tweets, Trump said he told Bolton on Monday night ""that his services are no longer needed at the White House."" He added that he and other colleagues disagreed with many of the suggestions made by Bolton, who returned in April 2018 to a public position for the first time since serving as ambassador to the U.N. under George W. Bush.

Bolton submitted his resignation Tuesday morning, Trump said, adding that he will announce a new national security adviser next week. Bolton offered a slightly different account on Twitter, saying he offered his resignation Monday night and that Trump told him, ""Let's talk about it tomorrow.""

According to precedent, deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman would inherit Bolton's responsibilities, though the president did not immediately indicate whether he would opt for another interim placeholder, as he has in the case of previous vacancies.

Top members of the administration defended the decision later in the day. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, in a press conference announcing new sanctions to which Bolton was originally to contribute, said the president is entitled to the staff he wants and declined to comment on the specifics of Bolton's departure.

""I don't talk about the inner workings of how this all goes,"" Pompeo said. ""There were many times Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed, that's to be sure, but that's true of lots of people with whom I interact.""

Mnuchin declined to say whether the administration's policy toward Tehran would change following the departure of one of its most noted Iran hawks but said that he, Pompeo and the president ""are completely aligned on our maximum pressure campaign.""

However Trump and Bolton's disagreements centered on the president's uneasiness about foreign intervention, including prospectively in Iran, having campaigned on bringing the U.S. home from costly, bloody overseas adventures in the Middle East, and an intensely hawkish approach to hostile governments in Caracas and Tehran. That divide had become increasingly evident recently, including in Bolton's exclusion from a high-stakes meeting on the future of the war in Afghanistan in April.

The president's tolerance for Bolton may have reached a breaking point in his apparent opposition to a summit with Taliban and Afghan leaders at Camp David, which reports indicate the president eagerly tried to initiate before simultaneously revealing and canceling the plans in a string of tweets over the weekend.

Trump's decision represents the latest disruption for a tumultuous position in this White House. His first national security adviser, retired Army Gen. Mike Flynn, resigned only weeks into the administration amid concerns he lied about contacts with Russian operatives."
Trump-Administration-Rolls.docx,"The Trump administration is scaling back some healthful school lunch standards championed by former first lady Michelle Obama, as it seeks to give schools more flexibility with meals.

Newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced Monday the changes for federally subsidized school meal programs during a visit to an elementary school in Leesburg, Va.

Schools, which receive federal funding for meal programs, won't have to meet certain guidelines for whole grain, sodium and milk.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the decision comes after years of feedback from schools and food-service experts, who have faced challenges meeting meal regulations; and from students, some of whom have complained that the meals aren't appetizing.

The department said the change ""begins the process of restoring local control"" over those food areas to give schools and states options in ensuring food choices are both healthy and appealing to students.

""If kids aren't eating the food, and it's ending up in the trash, they aren't getting any nutrition--thus undermining the intent of the program,"" Mr. Perdue said in a statement.

But American Heart Association Chief Executive Nancy Brown has concerns.

""USDA needs to remember that schools around the country are making great progress on healthy school meals, with more than 99% of schools already in compliance,"" Ms. Brown said in a statement. ""Rather than altering the current path forward, we hope the agency focuses more on providing technical assistance that can help schools get across the finish line, if they haven't done so already.""

The changes will allow states to grant exemptions in the 2017-2018 school year to schools experiencing hardship in finding a full range of products that meet whole-grain requirements; allow schools to meet past targets for sodium instead of new higher limits, to give more time to prepare appropriate foods; and allow schools to serve flavored 1% fat milk, instead of just fat-free.

Meal guidelines implemented in 2012, called historic at the time by the USDA, mandated that schools offer fruits and vegetables daily, increase offerings of whole grain-rich foods, offer only fat-free or low-fat milk varieties, limit calories based on the age of children to ensure proper portion size and give more focus on reducing saturated fat, trans fat and sodium.

Therefore, foods such as breaded beef patties, bean and cheese burritos and pizza sticks were out. And fares such as chef salad, whole wheat spaghetti and oven-baked fish nuggets were in.

Some students had complained early on that lunch food under the new rules was unappetizing and not filling. The USDA provided some flexibility under a temporary change, which became permanent in 2014, permitting larger portions of lean proteins and whole grains with meals.

The rules have extended beyond the lunch line, dictating what kinds of foods and beverages can be served in vending machines on school campuses. Foods sold outside of the lunch program but during the school day, such as for fundraisers, also must meet healthy standards."
BNATO_at_70.docx,"It's party time for NATO — and not just because the alliance celebrates its 70th birthday in Washington this week.

U.S President Donald Trump, convinced of his success in pushing allies to spend more on defense, has stopped bludgeoning NATO and hinting that he wants to quit. Instead, he has almost — almost — become a cheerleader. The once-unlikely comity was on display Tuesday afternoon, when Trump met with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House ahead of the alliance’s official gathering later this week.

Trump called it an “honor” to host Stoltenberg, saying the U.S. is with him “100 percent.”

It's not so long ago that things looked very different. Last July, Trump caused turmoil at a NATO summit in Brussels by unleashing a withering attack on Germany and threatening allies that the U.S. could ""go our own way"" unless they rapidly increase their military spending.

But Stoltenberg has proven to be a highly effective Trump-whisperer, repeatedly citing a figure of an extra $100 billion that NATO allies are in the process of spending on defense to help persuade the U.S. president that he is winning and the alliance is on the right track. For his efforts, Stoltenberg was rewarded last week with a two-year extension of his term, meaning he will stay in post until September 30, 2022.

NATO is also expanding. North Macedonia, having resolved its name dispute with Greece, is on track to become NATO's 30th member later this year. That adds a further dash of symbolism as NATO is already trumpeting its Four Thirties Readiness Initiative — the capability to deploy 30 combat ships, 30 land battalions and 30 air squadrons within 30 days.

Still, serious questions linger as NATO foreign ministers gather in the American capital to mark the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Washington Treaty — which launched the alliance — and Stoltenberg on Wednesday delivers a speech to Congress.

Military experts have expressed concern about NATO's preparedness to handle emerging rivals, how a traditional military alliance confronts asymmetrical threats — particularly terrorism but also hybrid and cyberattacks — and especially its failure so far to stop Russia's aggression, most recently on display in the Azov Sea.

Some allies have also lamented the Trump administration's decision to pull out of a nuclear treaty with Russia, even as they blame Moscow for violating the accord. NATO officials also concede that the focus on Russia, however necessary, has prevented the alliance from addressing other challenges, such as the rise of China.

Additionally, there are fears that some allies, notably Germany, have let their military capabilities crumble. And there are still nagging doubts about U.S. commitment, with Trump as commander-in-chief, stemming not just from his veiled threats to quit NATO, but also his comments about how defending an ally like Montenegro could lead to World War III.

Tensions between Trump and individual allies have generally eased — with the notable exception of Germany. Trump and his administration continue to hammer the country not just over military spending but also in terms of trade ties.

JFM_Doc1_Impeach-Donald-Trump.docx,"In january 20, 2017, Donald Trump stood on the steps of the Capitol, raised his right hand, and solemnly swore to faithfully execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. He has not kept that promise.

Instead, he has mounted a concerted challenge to the separation of powers, to the rule of law, and to the civil liberties enshrined in our founding documents. He has purposefully inflamed America’s divisions. He has set himself against the American idea, the principle that all of us—of every race, gender, and creed—are created equal.

This is not a partisan judgment. Many of the president’s fiercest critics have emerged from within his own party. Even officials and observers who support his policies are appalled by his pronouncements, and those who have the most firsthand experience of governance are also the most alarmed by how Trump is governing. 

“The damage inflicted by President Trump’s naïveté, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,” the late senator and former Republican presidential nominee John McCain lamented last summer. “The president has not risen to the mantle of the office,” the GOP’s other recent nominee, the former governor and now senator Mitt Romney, wrote in January.

The oath of office is a president’s promise to subordinate his private desires to the public interest, to serve the nation as a whole rather than any faction within it. Trump displays no evidence that he understands these obligations. To the contrary, he has routinely privileged his self-interest above the responsibilities of the presidency. He has failed to disclose or divest himself from his extensive financial interests, instead using the platform of the presidency to promote them. This has encouraged a wide array of actors, domestic and foreign, to seek to influence his decisions by funneling cash to properties such as Mar-a-Lago (the “Winter White House,” as Trump has branded it) and his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Courts are now considering whether some of those payments violate the Constitution.

More troubling still, Trump has demanded that public officials put their loyalty to him ahead of their duty to the public. On his first full day in office, he ordered his press secretary to lie about the size of his inaugural crowd. He never forgave his first attorney general for failing to shut down investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and ultimately forced his resignation. “I need loyalty. I expect loyalty,” Trump told his first FBI director, and then fired him when he refused to pledge it.

Trump has evinced little respect for the rule of law, attempting to have the Department of Justice launch criminal probes into his critics and political adversaries. He has repeatedly attacked both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His efforts to mislead, impede, and shut down Mueller’s investigation have now led the special counsel to consider whether the president obstructed justice."
Trumps_ever-shifting_shutdown_Blame_Game.docx,"First, President Donald Trump said he would take responsibility for any potential government shutdown. Later, as the partial shutdown got underway, it was top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer's fault. Then Trump placed the blame on top House Democrat and now House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Now? It's the fault of all the Democrats running to replace him in 2020.

Thirteen days in, the President and Democrats remain at odds over funding for a US-Mexico border wall, which has stymied negotiations on passing the funding broader measures needed to reopen the government.

Trump initially said he would ""take the mantle"" of blame for a shutdown due to border security disagreements, but ahead of Democrats' takeover of the House of R epresentatives on Thursday, he's sought to shift the blame onto the Democrats' future political ambitions.

""The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election,"" Trump tweeted Thursday. ""The Democrats know they can't win based on all of the achievements of 'Trump,' so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!""

Here's a rundown of the shifting list of who Trump says to blame for the shutdown:

In the now-infamous December 11, post-midterm-election Oval Office meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump invited in news cameras and then insisted he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government over border security and wall funding.

""I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,"" Trump said ""So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it.""

But on Thursday, top White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Trump won't own it anymore.

Asked if Trump regrets saying he'd take ownership of the shutdown, Conway said: ""He doesn't own the shutdown any longer.""

""The (Republican-led) House passed a $5.6 billion border security funding ... and now the Senate has to do its job."" Conway said, referencing a short-term spending bill on border security that House Republicans passed during the previous Congress but was never voted on by the Senate.  By December 30, about a week into the partial shutdown, Trump sought to blame Schumer.

""Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!"" Trump tweeted.

Trump's tweet apparently tries to refute Schumer and Pelosi's Oval Office reference to a potential shutdown as a ""Trump shutdown"" by labeling it a ""#SchumerShutdown.""

At that time, Republicans still controlled the House, but in order to reopen the government, Senate Democratic votes were needed -- making it, in Trump's mind, a Schumer shutdown.

More recently, White House officials moved to point fingers at Pelosi for the shutdown, suggesting she had to protect her chances of winning the House speakership by opposing the wall to appease liberals in her base.

That logic flies in the face of Pelosi's staunch opposition to the increase in border funding."
Letter-Judiciary.docx,"Obstruction of Justice.



The report's second part addresses a number of actions by the  President — most of which have been the subject of public reporting — that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns. After making a ""thorough factual investigation"" into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion — one way or the other — as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as ""difficult issues"" of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. The Special Counsel states that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""



The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime. Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel's office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel's obstruction investigation. After reviewing the Special Counsel's final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.



In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that ""the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,"" and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President's intent with respect to obstruction. Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President's actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of- justice offense."
CBW_Doc2_Trump-Brushes-Concerns.docx,"Trump brushes off concerns of recession, touts strong economy



President Trump offered an optimistic outlook of the economy Sunday and dismissed concerns of a looming recession after losses in financial markets last week and his ongoing trade war with China that some say will determine if he wins in 2020.

""I don't think we're having a recession,"" Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington from his New Jersey golf club. ""We're doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut and they're loaded up with money.""

Trump has consistently touted his economic record. He continued to spread his message over Twitter on Sunday.

""Our economy is the best in the world, by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA!,"" he posted.

Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, dismissed fears of a recession and predicted the economy will perform well in the second half of 2019.

""We're doing pretty darn well in my judgment. Let's not be afraid of optimism,"" Kudlow said, adding that consumers are earning more and are able to save and spend more.

As an economic analyst before joining the Trump administration, Kudlow was known for opposing tariffs and promoting free trade. He said Trump has taught him and others that the ""China story has to be changed and reformed.""

Democratic presidential candidate Beto' O'Rourke said Trump's trade war with China is ""hammering the hell out of farmers across this country.""

Democrats vying to unseat Trump have also criticized his handling of China.

""There is clearly no strategy for dealing with the trade war in a way that will actually lead to results for American farmers or American consumers,"" said presidential candidate and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

Trump has maintained that his tariffs are having an effect. He said China is ready to make a trade deal, but that he isn't..

""I'm just not ready to make a deal yet,"" Trump said. ""China would like to make a deal. I'm not ready.""

Last month, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark rate — which affects many loans for households and businesses — by a quarter-point to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, the first rate cute since 2008 during the Great Recession.

""The Federal Reserve chairman should look in the mirror and say, 'I raised rates too far, too fast, and I cost this economy a full percentage point of growth,'"" said Peter Navarro, who advises Trump on trade policy, said on a series of Sunday talk shows.



He has called for the lowering of interest rates to help stabilize U.S. markets.

Trump acknowledged a potential impact on consumers when he paused a planned 10 percent tariff hike on Chinese goods such as cell phones, video games, laptops and some toys.

""We're doing (it) just for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs could have an impact,"" he said.

Navarro said there was no evidence that consumer would bear the brunt of the tariffs."
SE_Doc1_Impeachment define elections.docx,"For the fourth time in American history, the House has embarked on the road to impeachment. Not in more than 150 years have the proceedings unfolded in the middle of a presidential election.

No one knows how this will play out, or what its collateral effects will be. Recent precedent offers no guide. Impeachment inquiries were launched against Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton during their second terms, when both were all-but-lame ducks. In 2020, we will see our democratic processes and traditions stretched close to the breaking point.

Maybe all of this was preordained anyway, given the recklessness of the current occupant of the White House. As Joe Lockhart, who was Clinton’s White House press secretary, said to me: “If Donald Trump is president, impeach him or not, he’s going to be the news every day. He has blotted out the sun.”

It is easy to forget that Democrats won back the majority in the House last year by pressing their case on issues that shape the everyday lives of families. With impeachment proceedings underway, there will be little oxygen left for any discussion of health care or infrastructure or college costs or anything beyond the question of Trump’s fitness for office. And if the investigation turns up anything short of a slam-dunk case to remove him, swing voters might punish a party they see as determined to overturn the result of the last presidential election.

All of this helps explain why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was so reluctant to set the formal process into motion, and why she would like to see it come to a conclusion as expeditiously as possible. Senior Democratic lawmakers and top leadership aides have told The Post that a House vote on articles charging President Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanors” could happen within weeks.

But that seems unrealistic. Rushing the process would only give credence to Trump’s near-hourly declarations that all of this is a “witch hunt.” And his White House is certain to resist congressional demands for documents and witnesses upon which the House could build its case, which means battles in the courts that could take months.

Meanwhile, Trump will galvanize his ever-loyal base, and his fundraising will skyrocket. The near-certainty that he would be acquitted by the Republican-held Senate will be spun as an exoneration.

An impeachment investigation will also shape the Democrats’ choice of a nominee, potentially foreshortening the race and freezing the current standings in place. Those who are struggling to break from the rear of a 19-person field will find it even harder — and maybe impossible — to make their voices heard in the din. “Candidates who have advantages now may see those advantages multiplied,” says David Axelrod, who was Barack Obama’s chief strategist.

One of the biggest unknowns is how all of this will affect the prospects of poll-leading Joe Biden. Trump’s brazen and improper play to enlist a foreign government to scuff up Biden assures that baseless allegations about him will be in the water. But even if Trump’s pressure on Ukraine failed, he continues to insist that Biden should be investigated and to spread evidence-free allegations about him. How Biden deals with it will likely be his greatest test as a candidate."
Trump-Puerto-Rico.docx,"It was arguably the biggest scandal and outrage of Donald Trump’s young, already scandal-ridden presidency.

With the bodies barely cold, the president instead launched sustained, petty public-relations warfare against politicians who he felt had crossed him and, at times, appeared to go to war with the victims of the storms.

Now, a year and a half after hurricanes Irma and María ravaged Puerto Rico, the island is grappling with a whole new round of crises, Trump has been telling his GOP allies that Puerto Rico is receiving too much assistance from the federal government, and lawmakers leading an investigation into what happened after the storms are being stalled.

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), who chairs the House Oversight Committee’s subcommittee on government operations, told The Daily Beast he still hasn’t seen key documents from the administration detailing its response to the hurricanes. He said the committee should be prepared to use its subpoena power to obtain those documents—and, if necessary, to hold officials in contempt of Congress if they don’t comply.

The remarks came as Democratic lawmakers are accusing Trump and his administration of dragging their feet on recovery funding, and as the Post reported that the devastated island is facing a food-stamp crisis.

The disaster and its aftermath left nearly 3,000 people dead, and the island is still struggling to recover nearly two years later.





Late last year, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), then incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent formal documents requests to FEMA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the “preparations and response” to the storms.

A source familiar with the situation told The Daily Beast that HHS had extended multiple offers to the committee to review data and documents on-site at the department, using its online-portal tracking mechanism. The source stated that all such offers have been declined.

Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill, however, continue to indicate they are still in the dark on the administration’s handling of Puerto Rico.

In September 2018, committee Democrats released a report arguing that the administration dramatically fumbled the response to the disaster—and that Trump’s Republican allies on the Oversight Committee had shut down a “credible investigation” into how that happened. 

Shortly after Democrats’ midterm victory, Cummings released FEMA documents detailing continued struggles in areas affected by the storm—like lack of access to clean water and reliable power—as evidence that Trump’s response was not, as the president had claimed, “unbelievable.”

As for Trump himself, this is more than just a matter of policy—it’s a matter of personal pride. According to those close to him, the president has long feared that Puerto Rico’s devastation, and his response and reactions to it, would become known as his Hurricane Katrina, the Category 5 hurricane that pummeled areas stretching from Florida to Texas in 2005."

Special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, has left his State Department post 

By 

Siobhan Hughes and 

Andrew Duehren

Updated Sept. 27, 2019 7:45 pm ET

WASHINGTON—House Democrats have settled on a narrow impeachment inquiry into President Trump centered on his campaign to enlist Ukraine to hurt a political rival, a rapid strategy that will produce hearings within a few weeks and build to a possible vote by November.

That plan was put into action immediately on Friday, when a trio of House committees issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for records of interactions between the president and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the Ukrainian government. 

The Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, which had requested the material about three weeks ago, also scheduled depositions starting next week with five State Department officials, including Kurt Volker, who late Friday resigned as the special envoy for Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter, after playing a role in arranging a meeting between Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and an aide to Ukraine’s president.

Mr. Volker in July introduced Mr. Giuliani to a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Andriy Yermak. The State Department, which has confirmed Mr. Volker introduced Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Yermak but has said Mr. Giuliani was acting in his capacity as a private citizen, didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The Democrats’ approach to the impeachment inquiry involves several committees but puts control into the hands of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and the Intelligence Committee—one of the only panels for which she has handpicked the Democratic members. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said Friday that members of his committee would work through the next two weeks, while Congress is officially in recess, and he is planning hearings as soon as next week.

“We’re going to be trying to schedule hearings, witness interviews, subpoenas and document requests. We’ll be busy,” Mr. Schiff said.

Do you think Democrats’ plan for a fast-paced, narrow investigation of President Trump will result in his impeachment by the House? Why or why not? Join the conversation below

The fast action—and discussions about resorting to a little-known congressional power to detain, arrest or fine recalcitrant witnesses—suggests the House could vote on articles of impeachment as soon as late October. The Judiciary Committee, which is traditionally the epicenter of impeachment proceedings, would draft the articles. 

The Judiciary panel has been investigating a broader array of behavior by Mr. Trump, including issues raised by former special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. But Judiciary members haven’t publicly complained about the arrangement that now puts the Intelligence Committee in the driver’s seat, with a tighter focus. 

“There is a dictate that momentum will not slow,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D., Conn.), the No. 2 Democrat on the Intelligence committee. “We are determined that momentum will not slow just because members aren’t in town.”"
Trump-to-meet.docx,"Egyptian officials are hailing the meeting, which came at the invitation of the US administration, as a high mark for a new era of relations between the two countries.

""President Sisi has been able to restore Egyptian-American relations to their former political and economic prosperity,"" said Ashraf Osman, an influential member of Egypt's parliament.

The meeting on Tuesday will focus on building the ""robust military, economic and counterterrorism cooperation"" between Washington and Cairo, the White House said.

But the meeting this week is not without controversy.

Human rights groups have accused the Egyptian regime of carrying out widespread and systematic torture of political prisoners, silencing dissidents and using death sentences to settle scores. Sisi's government has vehemently denied the allegations.

But rights groups continue to raise Cairo's dismal human rights record as an issue that congressmen should take into account when officials meet Sisi this week. It's a topic Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notably did not mention during his last visit to Cairo earlier this year .

Amnesty International along with Egyptians Abroad For Democracy Worldwide have been working for the last year in a joint effort to lobby Congress to ""oppose the death penalty in Egypt and to improve human rights,"" according to documents shared with CNN.

The groups are also lobbying to make $1.3 billion of military aid this year conditional on improving human rights in Egypt.

The State Department has sought the same amount in foreign military financing for Egypt in its 2020 budget request, indicating that the administration wants to keep business as usual with Cairo. Egypt is the second largest recipient of US foreign military aid. 

L ast year, the Trump administration released $195 million in military aid to Egypt which had been temporarily withheld due to concerns over the country's human rights record. The State Department cited ""steps"" taken by Cairo in response to ""specific U.S. concerns"" when the funds were released.

But rights groups continue to lobby Congress to make the annual military aid conditional on Egypt achieving certain democratic benchmarks. However, the White House has so far avoided such conditions by pressuring Congress to include a ""national security waiver"" on the aid legislation.

Amnesty and Egyptians Abroad for Democracy Worldwide have a letter that is circulating Congress to encourage members ""to consider the executions and human rights in their discussion on US financial aid to Egypt,"" Amnesty International's Egypt Country Specialist, Geoffrey Mock said.

But President Trump is likely to ignore those efforts as he holds talks with Sisi this week -- their sixth meeting since 2016, according a report released by Egypt's presidency.

Trump is not expected to mention controversial constitutional amendments, including an extension to Egyptian presidential terms that could see Sisi remain in office until 2034.

The two leaders are expected to talk about the fight against ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula, and a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to state-run Ahram Online citing a spokesman to the Egyptian president."
tephen-Moore_s-Unpaid.docx,"President Donald Trump’s controversial pick to fill an open seat on the Federal Reserve Board, Heritage Foundation fellow Stephen Moore, reportedly owes more than $75,000 in taxes and penalties to the US government.





After the Guardian first broke news of the tax lien against Moore in Montgomery County, Maryland, his wife, Anne Carey, told Bloomberg the unpaid sum stemmed from a mistake Moore made when filing his 2014 taxes. Carey said “it was not an attempt at defrauding the US government” and added that she and Moore were working to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.



Be that as it may, the news is the latest illustration of how Trump — who promised he’d “surround myself only with the best and most serious people” during his campaign — isn’t living up to that ideal in office.



When Trump announced Moore’s nomination to the Fed last week, Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs reported that a shockingly small amount of deliberation went into the choice. Trump reportedly decided on Moore after his chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow showed him over lunch an op-ed Moore co-wrote for the Wall Street Journal that argues the Reserve’s policies are hurting economic growth — a position that accords with Trump’s belief that the Fed’s gradual interest rate hikes are to blame for tamping down economic growth.



RELATED



Stephen Moore, the Trump loyalist nominated to the Fed, explained

Moore’s case rested on a false premise about deflation: He inaccurately claimed the economy is experiencing it, and recommended interest rate cuts as a way to address the fake problem. But Trump was reportedly so impressed with the piece that he ended up calling Moore and asking him if he’d be interested in a position on the board responsible for determining US monetary policy.



As Vox detailed last week, critics say that Moore — who as a CNN contributor established a reputation for defending Trump on any and all topics — is a staunch partisan who is unqualified to serve on the Fed. Though some Republicans have already expressed support for his nomination, his prospects of being confirmed in the Senate are uncertain.





More bad news about Moore breaking just days after his nomination isn’t likely to help his case. The chain of events is reminiscent of what happened about a year ago with Ronny Jackson, Trump’s former White House physician and onetime choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Shortly after Trump announced Jackson as his pick to lead the VA, reports emerged about him drinking on the job and mistreating staff. Jackson’s nomination was eventually pulled. More recently, in February, Trump’s pick for UN ambassador, Heather Nauert, withdrew from consideration for the job amid reports she employed a nanny who was in the country legally but didn’t have a proper work permit.



In both instances, embarrassing news cycles could’ve been avoided had the Trump administration done a better job vetting people before nominating them to high-profile positions."

America is deploying a new economic arsenal to assert its power. That is counterproductive and dangerous



WHEN DONALD TRUMP arrived in the Oval Office he promised to restore America’s might. His method has turned out to be a wholesale weaponisation of economic tools. The world can now see the awesome force that a superpower can project when it is unconstrained by rules or allies. On May 30th the president threatened crippling tariffs on Mexico after a row over migration. Markets reeled, and a Mexican delegation rushed to Washington to sue for peace. A day later preferential trading rules for India were cancelled. Its usually macho government did not put up a fight and promised to preserve “strong ties”. China faces a ratcheting up of tariffs soon, and its tech giant, Huawei, has been severed from its American suppliers. The country’s autocratic leaders are enraged, but on June 2nd they insisted they still seek “dialogue and consultation”. A tighter embargo on Iran, imposed over European objections, is strangling its economy.



President Trump must view this scene with satisfaction. Nobody takes America for granted any more. Enemies and friends know that it is prepared to unleash an economic arsenal to protect its national interest. America is deploying new tactics—poker-style brinkmanship—and new weapons that exploit its role as the nerve centre of the global economy to block the free flow of goods, data, ideas and money across borders. This pumped-up vision of a 21st-century superpower may be seductive for some. But it could spark a crisis, and it is eroding America’s most valuable asset—its legitimacy.



You might think that America’s clout comes from its 11 aircraft-carriers, 6,500 nuclear warheads or its anchor role in the IMF. But it is also the central node in the network that underpins globalisation. This mesh of firms, ideas and standards reflects and magnifies American prowess. Though it includes goods traded through supply chains, it is mainly intangible. America controls or hosts over 50% of the world’s cross-border bandwidth, venture capital, phone-operating systems, top universities and fund-management assets. Some 88% of currency trades use greenbacks. Across the planet it is normal to use a Visa card, invoice exports in dollars, sleep beside a device with a Qualcomm chip, watch Netflix and work for a firm that BlackRock invests in.



Foreigners accept all this because, on balance, it makes them better off. They may not set the rules of the game, but they get access to American markets and fair treatment alongside American firms. Globalisation and technology have made the network more powerful although America’s share of world GDP has fallen, from 38% in 1969 to 24% now. China cannot yet compete, even though its economy is approaching America’s in size.



Despite this, Mr Trump and his advisers are convinced that the world order is rigged against America, pointing to its rust-belt and its trade deficit. And rather than mimic the relatively restrained tactics of the last trade conflict, with Japan in the 1980s, they have redefined how economic nationalism works."
JMF_Doc2_McCarthy-calls-Pelosi.docx,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a letter on Thursday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., calling on her to suspend the impeachment inquiry into President Trump until “equitable rules and procedures” are set up.

Coming amid concerns by GOP lawmakers that they will be sidelined or shut out of the impeachment inquiry into Trump, McCarthy criticized Pelosi for the “swiftness and recklessness” which House committee chairs have proceeded with the impeachment inquiry and pleaded with the House speaker to ensure Republican participation in the proceedings.

“Unfortunately, you have given no clear indication as to how your impeachment inquiry will proceed – including whether key historical precedents or basic standards of due process will be observed,” McCarthy said in his letter. “In addition, the swiftness and recklessness with which you have proceeded has already resulted in committee chairs attempting to limit minority participation in scheduled interviews, calling into question the integrity of such an inquiry.”

Hours after McCarthy's letter was posted, Pelosi responded with her own note suggesting Democrats would not be hitting pause anytime soon. She wrote that ""existing rules of the House provide House Committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction.""

Pelosi added: ""We hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation’s history.""

McCarthy’s complaint about limiting Republican participation is a reference to reports that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was limiting Republicans' ability to ask questions during Thursday’s testimony by former U.S. envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker.

In his letter to Pelosi, McCarthy asked a number of questions, including whether Pelosi plans to hold a full House vote on authorizing the impeachment inquiry, whether she plans to grant subpoena powers to both the committee chairs and the ranking members, and whether she’ll allow Trump’s lawyers to attend the hearings.

After concerns were first raised about an ""equal playing field"" during the Volker session, Fox News is told Democrats made concessions and agreed to equal representation from Democratic and Republican counsels in the room. However, even though there are representatives from the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees, only the Intelligence Committee can ask questions.

Volker – who resigned from his post last week -- testified Thursday in a closed-door interview about an anonymous whistleblower’s complaint about a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s family’s dealings in the country.

Volker was expected to voluntarily give a transcribed interview before the Schiff-led Intelligence Committee as part of its impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his authority by asking Ukraine’s president to investigate Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination. Trump is being investigated amid claims that he threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the country."
The US is attacking Huawei and China — without its own 5G strategy.docx,"The United States and China are racing to build out high-speed 5G networks, and President Donald Trump doesn’t want America to come in second place.

Last week, Trump introduced initiatives to speed up the rollout of new wireless networks across the U.S., saying “the race to 5G is a race America must win.” But experts say the U.S. still lacks a clear 5G strategy that goes beyond attacking Huawei, a Chinese tech giant and the world’s biggest supplier of telecommunications equipment.

“I think they’ve been rather leaden-footed in the way they’ve responded,” Nigel Inkster, a former British intelligence official and senior advisor at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNBC’s Beyond the Valley. “Firstly by lacking an explicit, government-articulated strategy in relation to 5G which is only now starting to emerge, but also in arguing or shaping the challenge from China and from Huawei solely as an espionage issue.”

 

5G is designed to bring faster speeds and lower lag times than previous wireless networks like 4G and 3G. While much has been said about how the networks will give consumers faster downloads of videos or games, 5G is perhaps more importantly a potential game-changer for functions such as driverless cars or remote surgery that require quick, reliable internet connections.

In his speech last week, Trump emphasized that the private sector needs to lead the way in building 5G networks across the United States. Mobile operators including Verizon and AT&T have started rolling out the networks in select cities, with limited success so far. China, meanwhile, has taken a centralized approach to 5G, pumping investments into the technology as a government initiative.

  

U.S. officials say Chinese companies like Huawei should not allowed to build out the critical infrastructure, such as radio networking equipment and software, that will enable 5G. They warn that Huawei equipment could create a backdoor for the Chinese government to spy on American networks — a claim the company has repeatedly denied.

Intelligence experts have been skeptical about Huawei’s assurances that it isn’t a security risk, pointing to Chinese laws that appear to require domestic companies to assist the government in intelligence gathering when the communist party in Beijing requests it.

“The simple fact is, irrespective about the laws on espionage or anything else ... the actual reality is that in China, if the party wants something, they’re going to get it,” Inkster said.

 



5G is a centerpiece of China’s ambition to lead technology for the globe, according to Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham. He said China has the ability to “weaponize” technology like 5G.

“They seek to maximize the opportunities they have for extending their influence in the world and underpinning their global position and power,” he said in a phone interview on Thursday.

The U.S. has responded with an aggressive campaign to block Huawei in its own borders and to lobby traditional allies against it, too. Australia banned Huawei’s 5G equipment, Japan effectively did the same, and countries in Europe are assessing possible security threats.

Regardless, China is off to a strong start in the 5G race."
AMB_Doc1_Trump_Has_Confirmed.docx,"Trump Has Confirmed 150 Lifetime Federal Judges. That’s A Lot.

Democrats say they really only have one option for stopping more unqualified nominees: winning back the Senate in 2020.

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has been bragging about all the lifetime federal judges he’s gotten confirmed so far. He should! It’s a lot.

Look at where Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were at this point in their terms. Obama hadn’t confirmed nearly as many appeals court or district court judges. Bush had confirmed more district court judges by now, but Trump is way ahead of everyone on appeals court judges ― the people who have the final say in nearly all federal appeals cases around the country. Appeals courts resolve about 50,000 appeals cases per year; the Supreme Court resolves about 100.

Trump’s White House and Senate Republicans made a big push right out of the gate to confirm as many appeals court judges as possible precisely because of the concentrated power that rests with their courts. As a result, nearly 1 in every 4 seats on U.S. appeals courts is now filled by a judge appointed by Trump.

The quantity of Trump’s judges is almost as dramatic as the quality. Republicans have been confirming piles of unqualified and ideologically extreme people to lifetime court seats, many of whom have records of being anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ rights and anti-voting rights. In the meantime, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) keeps stripping away the few tools typically afforded to the minority, essentially shutting Democrats out of the process.

Since Trump took office, McConnell has blown up the Senate rules so Republicans could easily confirm the president’s Supreme Court picks. He forced another change in the rules to drastically reduce the amount of debate time for Trump’s district court picks. He’s routinely broken from Senate tradition by advancing judicial nominees over the objections of that nominee’s home-state senators.

And under his leadership, the GOP-led Judiciary Committee has stopped honoring “blue slips,” which means senators can no longer single-handedly block judicial nominees from their home states ― something Republicans did all the time when Obama was president.

So where does this leave Democrats? Surely there’s something these United States senators can do to prevent the president from putting problematic, out-of-the-mainstream people all over the nation’s courts.

Or ... not.

“We welcome any additional ideas,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). “But we have to win. We have to win the Senate. This just highlights the loss in costs of not having the votes here.”

“We’re doing everything we can,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). “If you care about the courts in our country and due process and justice, I’m hopeful we’ll have a different majority in January of 2021.”

 “Sen. Merkley and I have laid out for the Senate a pretty good example of how you stop extreme nominees,” Wyden said. “Do your homework. Get the facts out. And make sure your colleagues get to see it in time.”"
Republican Senators Discuss Including DACA in Wall Negotiationsgovernment.docx,"With Donald Trump working to keep his party unified in the government shutdown battle, some Senate Republicans have begun discussing expanding negotiations over the wall to include additional immigration issues, such as relief for DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

The conversation, mostly involving Republicans, picked up steam on Wednesday as the stalemate over the government shutdown and the border wall showed no signs of easing. While the discussions might be aimed at solving a number of long-standing immigration reform issues, they also risk stirring a backlash from conservatives who believe DACA relief to be a form of amnesty, and on the left from those who don't want it used as a negotiating tool.

""There is some discussions about whether a bigger deal could be negotiated that would include money for border security,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said after Trump met with Senate Republicans over lunch in the Capitol on Wednesday.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has formed a working group of senators to discuss a broader immigration deal. The starting point would be the Bridge Act, which provides legal work permits for people eligible for DACA relief in exchange for $25 billion for the wall.

Graham hosted the first meeting in his office Wednesday afternoon. Attendees included those who have expressed unease over the shutdown, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Rob Portman of Ohio and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has stepped into a leading White House role on the shut down, is also in attendance.

No Democrats joined the meeting but Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., met with Graham privately. Manchin said Graham presented some ideas to move the negotiations forward.

One Republican senator said that after a conversation with the president at the White House, the president appeared open to including DACA in wall negotiations to reopen the government. The senator, who didn't want to be identified because they are relaying private conversations, said they spoke to Trump's chief of staff Mick Mulvaney about including the issue of Temporary Protected Status. The Trump administration has ended TPS, or legal status, for at least 200,000 Central Americans and Haitians.

But Democrats have indicated that they don't want to bring DACA into discussions, in part, because they don't trust the president in negotiations.

During a previous negotiation on immigration, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said negotiating with Trump is like ""negotiating with Jell-O"" because after what appears to be a tentative agreement the president has backtracked. ""If he has trouble with this, imagine how much trouble he'll have with a bigger solution,"" Schumer said Wednesday about the prospect of broadening out the negotiations.

And the right is likely to immediately oppose a deal that includes DACA. Last week, conservative commentator Ann Coulter tweeted that ""NOTHING could be worse than another amnesty."""
China-Suggests-Trade.docx,"China Suggests a Trade Compromise With the Trump Administration

By Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson

March 9, 2019

BEIJING — A senior Chinese trade official called on Saturday for a compromise between the United States and China that could make a trade deal easier to reach this spring. But it could also lead to a more fragile agreement, which could fall apart quickly should trade frictions rise again.

Over the past year, the most contentious issue in the countries’ trade talks has been the Trump administration’s demand for what it calls an enforcement provision, which would allow the United States to monitor China’s behavior and put penalties in place if the Chinese violated the deal.

The Trump administration has pressed China to accept an agreement allowing the United States to unilaterally reimpose tariffs if it concludes that China has not gone through with structural changes to its economy. In the past month, the administration has also pushed for a broader enforcement mechanism, which would include the right to reimpose tariffs for any category of goods in which imports from China surge.

In exchange, the Trump administration would roll back at least some of the tariffs it placed on $250 billion of imports from China that it imposed last year, penalties that have strained ties between the governments, rocked financial markets and thrown the future of companies that operate in both countries in doubt.

Chinese officials have strongly resisted the idea of an enforcement provision. They worry that the Trump administration, or future ones, could invoke it at any time to restart trade frictions.

But Wang Shouwen, China’s vice minister of commerce for international trade negotiations, raised a possible compromise at a news conference in Beijing on Saturday morning. He said China would be amenable to an agreement that gave each side an equal right to take trade actions.

Fair and equal is China’s preferred term for an enforcement mechanism. He spoke at an annual news conference given by the Chinese Commerce Ministry’s top officials, in conjunction with the 11-day session of the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress.

While the Trump administration wants the right to reimpose tariffs unilaterally, China’s Commerce Ministry has favored creating a lengthy process of bilateral consultations if either side has a grievance.

In testimony before Congress on Feb. 27, Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, outlined a possible method for enforcing the deal under which the two sides would hold a regular series of meetings at multiple levels of government, and, if China violated the agreement, American tariffs would spring back into force.

The details of that proposal aren’t fully clear. But some American businesses are wary of a deal that would only allow them to air complaints through the government. They said such an arrangement could be time-consuming and ultimately lack the capacity to address many of the problems faced by American companies operating in China.

American businesses also contend that having the main penalty for violating the agreement be the reimposition of tariffs risks creating lasting uncertainty. The companies are now weighing whether to continue to invest in China or whether the prospect of additional levies would make it less risky to move operations abroad.

As long as the threat of tariffs looms, the United States and China could resolve their differences in the coming months, only to find themselves back in a similar stalemate next year. Mr. Wang said there had been progress during trade talks last month in Washington — and at least one moment of harmony. 

“They were both drinking water, they wanted to find common ground,” he said."
Rrade-Truce-Impact.docx,"A China-U.S. Trade Truce Could Enshrine a Global Economic Shift

Author: Keith Bradsher

Publication Date: June 29, 2019

OSAKA, Japan — The spin from President Trump and China’s propaganda machines on Saturday portrayed a truce in a trade war that has shaken economies and markets around the world. Tariffs won’t rise further, at least not yet. And the United States will loosen its potentially devastating punishments against Huawei, China’s most successful multinational company.

Yet the outlines of the tentative peace accord President Trump reached on Saturday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, could further cement a broad reshuffling of the global economic order that undermines China’s decades-long role as the world’s factory floor.

The details of the discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, still are not clear. The two sides have agreed to resume talks, but the ultimate results are not guaranteed. Their differences could still derail a fragile peace in an economic conflict that has thrown a shadowover the outlook for global growth.

Even a fragile truce could have lingering implications. The United States would keep in place broad tariffs on Chinese goods for months or perhaps years to come. Global companies would almost certainly respond by continuing to shift at least the final stages of their supply chains out of China.

 “As long as the threat is out there, there are risks in depending on these long supply chains,” said Jacques deLisle, director of the Center for the Study of Contemporary China at the University of Pennsylvania. “Businesses don’t like uncertainty, and this prolongs the uncertainty.”

In that regard, the results of the Osaka talks are similar to those when Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi met in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1, resulting in a truce that left in place higher American tariffs on Chinese-made goods. That truce lasted until May, when the Trump administration accused China of backtracking on a partially completed agreement that would have replaced tariffs with broad structural changes in the Chinese economy.

Leaving tariffs in place for the indefinite future has long been seen as the second-best solution by both sides. The Americans want fundamental economic policy changes in China, where the government heavily subsidizes local rivals to American companies.

Beijing officials want the tariffs dropped entirely. But they refuse to overhaul an economic model based on industrial subsidies and state-owned enterprises that they see as successful in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past four decades.

For China, the Osaka talks represent a short-term success. Mr. Trump postponed new tariffs on roughly $300 billion a year in Chinese goods that he had threatened to impose at some unspecified date if Beijing did not come back to the negotiating table. He also said he would weaken limits his administration had imposed on the American technology that Huawei could use, without offering specifics. Those limits cut off the Chinese telecom equipment giant from the semiconductors and other technologies it needs, a shopping list that the company has said totals $11 billion annually.

Perhaps most important, China has persuaded the United States to return to the bargaining table without agreeing to any of the legislative changes that the Trump administration saw as essential, but which Beijing regarded as an affront."
CBW_Doc1_Buttigieg-Trump-Administration.docx,"Buttigieg: Trump administration's China tariffs 'a fool's errand'

President Donald Trump is on a ""fool's errand"" with his ongoing trade war with China, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said Sunday.

CNN's Jake Tapper asked the South Bend, Indiana, mayor on ""State of the Union"" in an exclusive interview why he thinks China would strike a trade deal with him if, as president, he were to ease Trump's pressure and end the President's tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. The US, Buttigieg said, has ""a lot of different forms of leverage in the relationship.""

""But it's also a fool's errand to think you will be able to get China to change the fundamentals of their economic model by poking them in the eye with some tariffs,"" he said.



Buttigieg's comments come as fears of a recession in the US grow, with critics of the President's economic policies pointing to Trump's trade war with China as a contributing factor in the potential economic slowdown.Last week, the Trump administration -- in its latest turnaround on trade -- said it would delay new tariffs on Chinese-made consumer goods including cell phones, toys and video game consoles until December 15.

Last year, Trump imposed tariffs on about $250 billion in Chinese-made goods, targeting industrial materials and components. Earlier this month, he said he would add a 10% tariff on an additional $300 billion of Chinese-made products on September 1, which would effectively put a tax on all Chinese goods coming into the United States.

Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon about negotiating trade deals with China, writing the country is ""Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed.""

""Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in,"" Trump wrote.

Buttigieg, in his interview Sunday, expressed concern for American farmers, who he said were getting ""killed"" by Trump's trade war. Farmers have been among some of the hardest hit by China's retaliatory tariffs, which were put on a range of commodities including soybeans, corn and wheat.

""I was just in Iowa, in rural parts of the state, talking with a lot of farmers who -- many of whom are Republicans or supported this President and are now asking the question, 'How much longer are we supposed to take one for the team?' The President has said repeatedly that he's on the cusp of getting a deal. The President has failed to deliver a deal and I expect he will continue to do so,"" Buttigieg said."
Shutdown.docx,"WASHINGTON — The partial government shutdown is inflicting far greater damage on the United States economy than previously estimated, the White House acknowledged on Tuesday, as President Trump’s economists doubled projections of how much economic growth is being lost each week the standoff with Democrats continues.

The revised estimates from the Council of Economic Advisers show that the shutdown, now in its fourth week, is beginning to have real economic consequences. The analysis, and other projections from outside the White House, suggests that the shutdown has already weighed significantly on growth and could ultimately push the United States economy into a contraction.

While Vice President Mike Pence previously played down the shutdown’s effects amid a “roaring” economy, White House officials are now cautioning Mr. Trump about the toll it could take on a sustained economic expansion. Mr. Trump, who has hitched his political success to the economy, also faces other economic headwinds, including slowing global growth, a trade war with China and the waning effects of a $1.5 trillion tax cut.

To blunt the shutdown’s effects, the administration on Tuesday called tens of thousands of employees back to work, without pay, to process tax returns, ensure flight safety and inspect food and drugs. But some people involved in the shutdown discussions in the White House have privately said they anticipate that Mr. Trump will grow anxious about the economic impact in the coming days, accelerating an end to the stalemate. Others close to the president believe Mr. Trump has leverage and are encouraging him to stand by his demands.

For now, the White House shows no signs of being ready to relent, and Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, continued to blame Democrats for the economic damage.

“Congress needs to look at the harms that we’re talking about,” Mr. Hassett said, “and address them.”

Mr. Hassett said on Tuesday that the administration now calculates that the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points for every week that it lasts — the cumulative effect of lost work from contractors and furloughed federal employees who are not getting paid and who are investing and spending less as a result. That means that the economy has already lost nearly half a percentage point of growth from the four-week shutdown. (Last year, economic growth for the first quarter totaled 2.2 percent.)

 

Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said on Tuesday that one of his furloughed staff members had begun driving for Uber to make ends meet.

 

Mr. Trump has demanded that Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, include $5.7 billion for a border wall in any measure to fund the government. Democrats have refused and, along with some Republicans, have tried to persuade the president to reopen the government and negotiate border security afterward. The House has passed several bills to fund parts of the government, including the Internal Revenue Service, that are not related to border security. Senate Republicans have declined to schedule votes on those bills.

On Tuesday, in an effort to try to splinter the Democrats’ opposition, the White House invited several House Democrats from districts Mr. Trump won to discuss a path forward. None showed up.

The impasse has left 800,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay, along with throwing thousands of government contractors at least temporarily off the job."
US-China-trade-war-deal-90 per cent complete.docx,"A trade deal between China and the United States is “90 per cent completed”, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said just three days before a high-stakes meeting between the countries’ two top leaders.

In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Mnuchin said this week’s Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, where Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump are expected to meet, would be “a very important G20”.

“We were about 90 per cent of the way there [to a trade deal] and I think there’s a path to complete this,” he said, without specifying the remaining 10 per cent.

“The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the US economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship.”

The upbeat assessment is the most positive comment from a senior official directly involved in talks to end a costly trade war between the world’s two largest economies since negotiations broke down early last month.

Also on Wednesday, Bloomberg cited sources saying the US was considering suspending its next round of tariffs on another US$300 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing has insisted that it will not agree to any deal under the threat of tariffs.

But China has largely remained tight-lipped. Before going to Japan, Xi called a meeting on Monday with the other 24 members of the Politburo, the Communist Party’s inner circle.

Other than a terse and heavily scripted report afterwards, there was little information about what the cadres discussed but official media offered some clues.

Immediately after the meeting, Xi arranged a special study session for the Politburo on “remembering the mission and conducting self-revolution”, according to party journal Qiushi.

“Self-revolution” is a term often used to refer to the need to overcome petty local interests for the greater good of the party.

Xi warned against “lurking risks” everywhere that could subvert the party’s mission, and stressed the importance of unity around party leadership.

He also called on the senior officials to learn lessons from previous crises in the party.

“Why has our party been able to survive bloodbath after bloodbath, and achieve victory after victory?” Xi said. “It’s because we resolutely marched towards the goal of national rejuvenation and won firm support from the people.”

While these reports made no direct mention of the US, they can be seen as a coded call for other top party leaders to rally behind Xi and give him political support ahead of tense talks with Trump.

The Monday meeting was technically the only opportunity for Xi to gather all top officials – many posted outside Beijing – to discuss key issues and forge consensus.

The South China Morning Post reported earlier that during the previous Politburo meeting in May, Xi canvassed the other Politburo members for their views on the latest US demands. The group had decided to reject some of the demands from Washington that were deemed as challenging the party’s rule in China, leading to the collapse of the trade talks."
Totally-bonkers-Trump.docx,"At the end of a chaotic day punctuated by a failed meeting President Trump and Democratic leaders intended to end the partial government shutdown, the president took to Twitter late Wednesday night to air his well-worn grievances about a familiar adversary — the media.

In tweets and retweets, Trump once again voiced disdain for the ""Mainstream Media,” specifically naming NBC and MSNBC as the source of his ire, while also touting support for himself and his controversial wall ahead of a visit to the southern border Thursday.

The president began by attacking the news outlets for being “dishonest” and describing them as the “Opposition Party working with the Dems” in two tweets shared 10 minutes apart.

He went on to complain about network anchors, claiming they “quickly leaked the contents” of an “OFF THE RECORD luncheon” that occurred before his prime-time address Tuesday. Trump was likely referencing a New York Times story reporting that the president had complained in that meeting that he didn’t want to give the televised speech or go to the border but that aides had talked him into it. “It’s not going to change a damn thing, but I’m still doing it,” the Times reported him saying in the luncheon.

“Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!” Trump tweeted.

Trump then proceeded to retweet flattering messages of support that championed the border wall.

The president reposted four tweets from one of his most vocal supporters, Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, a pro-Trump organization. Two of Kirk’s tweets advocated the need for the wall, citing misleading statistics about illegal activity happening at the southern border. In another tweet that the president retweeted, Kirk wrote that Trump is “winning this shutdown fight” and urged the president to “stand your ground.”

The retweets also included a tweet from his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who wrote that he had “just received my newest voter score tracking from my team.""

“@realDonaldTrump has reached his highest national approval rating since I started tracking,” Parscale boasted. “The @TheDemocrats have really made a mistake going with their gut over data.""

Trump capped his late-night flurry of Twitter activity by retweeting conservative commentator Dan Bongino, who had shared a link about a poll purporting to show widespread concern about border security. 

On Tuesday, the president delivered his first prime-time address from the Oval Office in which he gravely informed Americans that his wall is the only solution to the “growing humanitarian and security crisis” at the southern border. But Wednesday, it appeared that his plea did little to sway congressional Democrats who continued to refuse to grant him funding for the wall, prompting the president to storm out of a tense shutdown negotiation meeting. Trump also is beginning to lose support from some members of his own party over his shutdown strategy as eight House Republicans voted in favor of a plan backed by Democrats to reopen the Treasury Department even if border wall funds are not secured, The Washington Post’s Felicia Sonmez and John Wagner reported."
CMC_Doc2_trade_war_global_economy.docx,"Donald Trump’s trade war can’t solve America’s problems, but it is creating plenty for the global economy. Since Donald Trump launched his tariff war, US trade and budget deficits have only grown, and now the US economy is slowing.

It would be better to tame runaway US consumerism and start policy coordination with other major powers to stave off a recession. Deepening political divisions and growing fears pose the biggest challenges for the global economy right now. America’s trade war with China and Britain’s Brexit spat with Europe are doing no favours for global growth just when the world economy needs as much goodwill and positive drive as possible.

US President Donald Trump wants to make America great again but sees globalisation standing in the way. It’s a sobering reminder that the US needs more radical economic restructuring to stay ahead in a fast-changing world. Without a major overhaul, all Trump can do is soften the blow with more tax cuts and increased government spending, placing further strains on the US budget and trade deficits.

Global trade flows are shrinking, US growth is flattening and world recovery prospects have been seriously dimmed. For all of Trump’s ambitions to decouple from China and pull manufacturing jobs back to the US, it’s a lost cause so far. The White House appears out of its depth, lacking the vision and means to mend the US economy over the long term.

The loss of US production capacity overseas is down to lost decades of policy, benign neglect and underinvestment in domestic industrial infrastructure. Trump fears China getting bigger and better as a global manufacturing force but has little idea how to tackle it.

The ideal would be for both sides to patch up their differences, learn to adapt and evolve together. US exports of aircraft, soybeans, autos and microchips are just as vital to China’s economy as China’s exports of smart phones, electrical and household goods are key to the US, the world’s leading consumer market. It’s the embodiment of how the global trading system ought to run successfully under commonly agreed rules and cooperation.

Neither side should rock the boat. It is pointless for Trump to complain about unfair trading practices, claiming currency manipulation foul play or leaning on US companies to withdraw from doing business with China. Decoupling is not going to solve America’s US$400 billion annual trade deficit with China.

By decoupling, Trump would only build bigger trade gaps with competitors elsewhere in Asia and Europe. Trump is already grousing about the euro dropping “like crazy” against the dollar. The US must put its own house in order first.

Until America reins in unfettered consumerism and stops excessive domestic demand leaking overseas, it will continue to aid stronger growth abroad rather than at home. Better balanced domestic reflation is an urgent priority for the US, and for China.

The US and China need to build up their domestic recoveries and sort out their external differences for the world’s sake, and soon."
SE_Doc2_Democratic candidates back impeachment.docx,"Leading Democratic presidential candidates were nearly unanimous in backing impeachment proceedings against President Trump after he tried to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.

“Now the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter. “The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment — and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.”

Speaker Nancy Pelosi(D-San Francisco)announced Tuesday that the House will open an impeachment inquiry over Trump’s solicitation of a Ukrainian investigation targeting Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

Trump froze millions of dollars in congressionally approved aid to Ukraine a few days before a phone call to President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he raised unsubstantiated allegations against Biden and the former vice president’s son, Hunter, who did business there.

Trump has confirmed that he spoke to the Ukrainian president about the Bidens; he also acknowledged that he held up military aid for the nation that is fighting Russia-backed separatist rebels. He said Monday he had withheld the aid over corruption concerns; Tuesday he said he did so because he thought European allies were not contributing enough.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont agreed with Warren, saying the president may have “used funds designed to protect the security of the United States as a means to gain political dirt on an opponent.”

Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said Congress must act against a president who fails to respect the checks and balances of government. He dismissed concerns among Democrats that impeachment could backfire by generating public sympathy for Trump.

“What we’re facing isn’t a political issue, it’s a moral one,” he said in a statement. “In 2016, Trump openly welcomed foreign adversaries to meddle in our democracy for his own political gain. Now, by his own admission, he appears to be using the same playbook to undermine our democratic institutions and remain in power.”

Many of the Democrats running for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination had already called for Trump’s impeachment over alleged obstruction of justice in the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.



One of them, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, said Trump’s solicitation of Ukraine’s assistance for his reelection campaign provided a new reason to start the impeachment process.

“Donald Trump has abused his power, obstructed justice, and violated his oath of office,” Harris said on Twitter. “He puts his political interests over our national interest. I agree with @SpeakerPelosi — no one is above the law. He must be impeached.”

Biden said Tuesday that Trump should be impeached if he fails to cooperate with House investigators.

Candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., told MSNBC that Trump had “made it clear that he deserves to be impeached,” saying the president’s admitted request for a Ukrainian investigation of Biden was “shocking.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former U.S. Housing Secretary Julián Castro, New York businessman Andrew Yang, San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer and others joined their Democratic rivals in welcoming the impeachment investigation."
SAP_Doc2_Biden_Trump_Impeachment_Comply_Congress_Inquiry.docx,"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday called on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump if he does not comply with all Congress’ request for information about a July call he made to Ukraine’s president in which he discussed Biden. 

The former vice president spoke out against Trump as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that Democrats would launch an impeachment inquiry over allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden’s son Hunter’s business dealings in the Eastern European country.

""It's time for this administration to stop stonewalling and provide the Congress with all the facts it needs,"" Biden said.""It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president. The president should stop stonewalling this investigation and all the other investigations into his alleged wrongdoing. 

""If the president does not comply with such a request of the Congress, if he continues to obstruct Congress, and flaunt the law,"" Biden added, ""Donald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment.""

""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,"" Trump added. ""No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!""

Earlier on Tuesday, Trump denied that he withheld aid money from Ukraine to try to cajole Zelensky to have his government launch an investigation into Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of the Ukraine energy company Burisma Group.

Trump earlier this week admitted that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden. And on Tuesday Trump acknowledged that he slowed military aid payments to Ukraine this summer, but he said it had nothing to do with trying to pressure Ukraine officials. Instead, he said that he slowed the aid because the United States was paying too much while other countries weren’t paying enough.

But Trump also acknowledged that he told the Ukraine leader that Biden's actions as vice president and the Ukraine business interests of his son warrant investigation.

Trump has also said he had concerns about providing aid to Ukraine because of ""corruption"" in the country.

Pelosi called Trump's actions a 'betrayal of national security"".

Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and civil rights icon, on Tuesday also joined calls to begin impeachment proceedings. The senior House member, who until now had resisted calls from the liberal wing of his party for impeachment, could auger more senior Democrats shifting their stances.

""We cannot delay. We must not wait,"" Lewis said in a speech on the House floor Tuesday. ""Now is the time to act. I have been patient while we tried every other path and used every other tool. I truly believe that the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come.""

The issue came to a head after a multiple news reports last week about a whistleblower complaint brought by a member of the intelligence community raised concerns about Trump’s comments to a foreign leader.  The whistleblower complaint remains secret."
FBI_Opened_Inquiry.docx,"In the days after President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, law enforcement officials became so concerned by the president’s behavior that they began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests, according to former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation. The inquiry carried explosive implications. Counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether the president’s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security. Agents also sought to determine whether Mr. Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unwittingly fallen under Moscow’s influence. The investigation the F.B.I. opened into Mr. Trump also had a criminal aspect, which has long been publicly known: whether his firing of Mr. Comey constituted obstruction of justice. Agents and senior F.B.I. officials had grown suspicious of Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off on opening an investigation into him, the people said, in part because they were uncertain how to proceed with an inquiry of such sensitivity and magnitude. But the president’s activities before and after Mr. Comey’s firing in May 2017, particularly two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the Comey dismissal to the Russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry, the people said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, took over the inquiry into Mr. Trump when he was appointed, days after F.B.I. officials opened it. That inquiry is part of Mr. Mueller’s broader examination of how Russian operatives interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Trump associates conspired with them. It is unclear whether Mr. Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and some former law enforcement officials outside the investigation have questioned whether agents overstepped in opening it. The criminal and counterintelligence elements were coupled together into one investigation, former law enforcement officials said in interviews in recent weeks, because if Mr. Trump had ousted the head of the F.B.I. to impede or even end the Russia investigation, that was both a possible crime and a national security concern. The F.B.I.’s counterintelligence division handles national security matters. If the president had fired Mr. Comey to stop the Russia investigation, the action would have been a national security issue because it naturally would have hurt the bureau’s effort to learn how Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Americans were involved, according to James A. Baker, who served as F.B.I. general counsel until late 2017. He privately testified in October before House investigators who were examining the F.B.I.’s handling of the full Russia inquiry. “Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,” Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times. Mr. Baker did not explicitly acknowledge the existence of the investigation of Mr. Trump to congressional investigators."
AMZ_Doc2_Trump_trade_war_pain_manufacturing_states.docx,"President Trump’s trade war is taking a toll on the economy. Manufacturing is already feeling much of the fallout due to the higher costs, fewer overseas market and greater economic uncertainty. Yet manufacturing jobs aren’t distributed evenly across the country. Not surprisingly, employment growth has slowed more in manufacturing states than in non-manufacturing states with many manufacturing states already seeing declining total jobs numbers.

This trade policy has had three major effects on the U.S. economy and jobs. First, import tariffs will increase costs for consumers and have already burdened businesses. Greater costs, though, mean less spending and slowing economic growth. Second, there is no apparent strategy to the President’s trade war and thus there is no clear signal when and how the various trade disputes will end. This creates a lot of uncertainty for people and businesses. Families are holding off on buying a house and construction slows. Businesses across the economy don’t know what their inputs will cost in the coming months and whether overseas markets will shrink or expand. They are holding off on investing in new manufacturing plants, buying new equipment and expanding other capacity. In the second quarter of 2019, business investment declined as a result. Third, it is getting harder for businesses to sell their goods overseas as other countries retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. exports. Not surprisingly, manufacturing activity shrank for the first time in three years in the summer of 2019. 

The President’s approach to international trade has taken a toll on job growth. Average monthly job creation was 187,200 between July 2018 and July 2019, compared to 204,000 in the preceding twelve months – a drop of 16,830 in the number of jobs created each month. The decline came largely from slowing manufacturing employment, where average monthly job growth dropped by 11,080 during that period. Declining manufacturing job growth thus equaled almost two-thirds of the total slowdown in job growth, with a drop in construction job growth accounting for all of the rest.

Some states depend more heavily on manufacturing and the good jobs it brings than others. Manufacturing employment accounts for above-average shares of economic activity, for instance, in large states such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, while it is fairly small in larger states such as Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and New York.

Manufacturing states have seen larger slowdowns in employment growth than non-manufacturing states, defined as manufacturing employment shares of less than seven percent. On average, employment growth slowed by 3,500 jobs in manufacturing states, by 2,400 jobs in non-manufacturing states, as the trade war affected other areas such as agriculture, construction and consumer spending. 

Donald Trump’s approach to international trade has slowed the economy and the labor market, just as workers across the income spectrum finally saw meaningful wage gains due to the tightening job market. Most states have seen slowing job growth and many have seen flat and falling jobs since early this year. The fallout from the job market slowdown has already been felt unevenly, especially in large manufacturing states."
Trump-Highlights-Human.docx,"President Trump on Thursday visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas and argued a barrier made of steel would deter human trafficking and drugs, amid stalled negotiations with Democrats over funding the border project and ending the partial government shutdown.

""Where you have a good strong barrier, you don't have problems,"" the president told reporters during his tour.

Back in Washington, Democrats in the Senate on Thursday failed to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border wall money. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, blocked that effort, saying it amounts to “pointless show votes.”

During an afternoon briefing with border agents at a patrol station in McAllen, Trump highlighted the prevalence of guns and drugs along the border. The president spoke in front of a table of items border agents have seized, including a rifle, handguns, a plastic bag full of cash and black-taped bricks of heroin and meth.

“If we had a barrier of any kind, a powerful barrier, whether it’s steel or concrete...We would stop it cold,” Trump said of human trafficking.

The president famously promised during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for the border wall. But on Thursday, the president argued Mexico could still contribute to it indirectly, even though he’s demanding $5.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer money to pay for the wall.

“When I say Mexico’s going to pay for the wall...I didn’t say they’re going to write me a check for 10 billion or 20 billion,"" Trump said during the briefing. ""If Congress approves this trade bill, they’ll pay for the wall many times over. When I say Mexico’s going to pay for the wall, that’s what I mean.""

Before leaving the White House for Texas, the president insisted he is still willing to declare a national emergency if Congress doesn’t approve funding for a barrier along the border.

""I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” Trump told reporters. “The lawyers have so advised me. I'm not prepared to do that yet, but if I have to, I will.”

The National Emergencies Act grants the president broad authority to declare emergencies, which could clear a path for the White House to move ahead with building a wall.

The visit comes on the 20th day of the ongoing partial federal government shutdown affecting nearly 800,000 federal workers. Funding has lapsed for some parts of the government, as Congress has been unable to pass a spending bill. Trump is asking for funding for a border wall in the spending package, something Democrats are rejecting.

On Wednesday, Trump walked out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after Pelosi again rejected supporting new funding for a border wall.

On Tuesday, the president addressed the nation from the Oval Office about the situation at the border, with Trump declaring a “humanitarian and security crisis."" But Democratic congressional leaders responded by saying Trump was working to “manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration."""
David Williams Week 1 File 2.docx,"President Donald Trump's former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, expressed strong concerns Sunday about the president's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and said if Trump does not give up his fixation on debunked 2016 election allegations, it will ""bring him down.""

""I’m deeply disturbed by it [the call] as well and this entire mess has me frustrated,"" Bossert said on ABC's ""This Week"" when asked about a whistleblower complaint made public last week. ""I’ve just spent a week overseas, and I’ll tell you, the whole world is watching this. The removal of a president is a — is a big and serious deal. But the removal of a president in not only a democracy, but the biggest democracy in the world is really a weighty matter, and I hope that everyone can sift through the evidence and be very careful, as I’ve seen a lot of rush to judgment this week.""



""That said, it is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent,"" he continued. ""But it looks to me like the other matter that’s far from proven is whether he was doing anything to abuse his power and withhold aid in order to solicit such a thing.""



Bossert's comments come amid a series of revelations surrounding the president's Ukrainian efforts, namely the Thursday release of a whistleblower's complaint at the center of the ordeal. The whistleblower wrote that White House officials were so concerned about what Trump said in a July call with Zelenskiy that they intervened to ""lock down"" the record of the conversation.

In the call, Trump discussed Zelenskiy help investigate the Biden family's business dealings. Former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The matter is now the subject of a formal impeachment inquiry launched by the House this week.

On Wednesday, the White House released a detailed summary of the president's discussion with Zelenskiy, which showed Trump asked the Ukrainian president to look into why that country's top prosecutor apparently had ended an investigation into the company, Burisma Holdings, where Biden’s son was a board member.



Bossert, who was fired from the administration last year shortly after now ex-national security adviser John Bolton took that post, said he ""didn't see"" Trump pressuring Zelenskiy in the call but understood why it was being interpreted in that way.



""I’ve spent a lot of time with this president, and I can easily see other reasons for why this president might have delayed the aide to Ukraine and those Javelin missiles,"" he said. ""In fact, as you know, President Obama considered this deeply and decided not to provide lethal military support. President Trump and I and others spent quite a bit of time talking about this.""

At another point in the call, Trump appeared to ask Zelenskiy about the debunked ""CrowdStrike"" conspiracy regarding the hack of the Democratic National Committee's emails. That theory turns the focus away from Russia's culpability — which former special counsel Robert Mueller said was the case in his extensive report — and instead place some doubt into whether Russia was the culprit."
AMB_Doc2_Senate_Confirms_150th.docx,"The U.S. Senate confirmed President Trump’s 150th judicial nominee Wednesday, helping to fulfill the president’s campaign promise to remake the federal bench with a conservative bent.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham called the number of confirmations a “historic milestone.”

“These conservative judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come,” the South Carolina Republican said.

Six district court nominees won confirmation Wednesday, bringing the president’s total number of appointed judges to the lower federal courts to 105. Mr. Trump has also appointed 43 circuit court nominees and two Supreme Court justices since taking office.

The pace has far outdone President Obama, who only saw 20 circuit court nominees and 74 district court judges confirmed during the same period of time. Mr. Obama, though, like Mr. Trump had two Supreme Court appointments within his first three years.





Liberal advocacy groups said the 150th judicial confirmation is alarming, stressing the need to make judicial nominees and the courts a 2020 campaign issue.

“As of today’s confirmation votes, Trump and McConnell have confirmed 150 judges to the federal bench — a group that can overwhelmingly be described as narrow-minded and elitist, favoring corporations and the powerful over the interests of all Americans,” said Marge Baker, executive vice president of the People for the American Way.

Trump-Netanyahu-Israel.docx,"With a tweet posted on Thursday, President Donald Trump dismissed five decades of international consensus on the status of the Golan Heights, Syrian territory seized by Israel in 1967 during a pre-emptive war, declaring that the United States would recognize Israel’s annexation of the region.

Offered without explanation, the move looked to many Israeli, Palestinian, and American observers like a transparent attempt to boost the re-election prospects of Trump’s embattled ally, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces corruption charges and could be defeated at the polls next month. 



Trump’s declaration, ElBaradei noted, flies in the face a United Nations Security Council resolution adopted unanimously in 1967, which called for the “withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied” in that summer’s conflict — including the Golan, as well as the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza — and emphasized, “the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war.”

Early Friday, a spokesperson for the Syrian government, which still controls about a third of the region, told the state news agency SANA that Trump’s statement “on the occupied Syrian Golan will never change the fact that the Golan was and will always be a Syrian Arab territory and that the Syrian people are more determined to liberate it by all possible means no matter what.”

In an interview with Fox Business News recorded on Thursday, Trump offered a less-than-convincing denial of the suggestion that his announcement was related to Netanyahu’s re-election campaign. 

In the same interview, Trump also claimed, falsely, that previous presidents had promised during their campaigns for office to recognize Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights. 

Netanyahu’s biographer, Anshel Pfeffer, suggested that the timing of the announcement, ahead of the Israeli prime minister’s visit to the White House next week, might have been an attempt to distract Israel’s electorate from another brewing scandal. “Netanyahu is petrified,” Pfeffer argued in Haaretz on Friday, “that the new revelations on his trading in shares in his cousin’s company, which netted him $4.3 million and may have a connection with the company’s dealings with the German shipyard from which Israel purchases its submarines, could dominate the last stage of the election campaign.”

American allies in Europe said that Trump’s statement had no impact on the status of the Golan Heights under international law.

 “The UK views the Golan Heights as territory occupied by Israel,” the British Foreign Office said in a statement on Friday. “Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter. We did not recognise Israel’s annexation in 1981 and have no plans to change our position.” The European Union reiterated that it “does not recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967, including the Golan Heights, and does not consider them to be part of Israel’s territory.”

Since Trump has now declared his support for Israel’s previously unrecognized annexations of both East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, speculation naturally turned to what might come next: the annexation of most or all of the occupied West Bank."
Trade-Announcement.docx,"Winners and losers in Trump’s big China trade announcement


Author: Heather Long

Publication Date: June 29, 2019



President Trump cooled off his trade war with China this weekend, announcing he would hold off imposing more tariffs. Many businesses are cheering the move, which happened Saturday morning in Japan (Friday night in the United States) on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting of world leaders.



Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to keep talking, reviving hopes of a deal soon. Trump called his time with Xi “great” and “beautiful.”

Many expected a restart in trade talks, which collapsed two months ago, leading Trump to increase tariffs on the Chinese and pursue sanctions on the Chinese tech behemoth Huawei. But China got almost all of what it wanted from this meeting: Trump agreed to hold off on more tariffs, and he made some concessions regarding Huawei. In exchange, Trump said, Xi agreed to buy more U.S. farm products.



It’s too soon to tell whether the fragile truce will hold, but for now, here’s a rundown of the winners and losers from this round of U.S.-China talks.



Winners



China — China may have lost at the World Cup in France, but the nation had a strong showing at the G-20. China won some concessions from the United States. Trump agreed he would not put tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports while they keep talking. Trump also rolled back some restrictions on Huawei, which faced a far darker future if it couldn’t do business with U.S. tech companies. In exchange, China agreed to resume some purchases of U.S. agricultural products — something China wants anyway and has been offering for more than a year. (It’s not clear how much China will buy.)



American retailers (Walmart, Target, Amazon, etc.) — Big sigh of relief. Trump had threatened to put tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports, including items such as smartphones, baby products and shoes. But those tariffs are off the table for now. This is a huge win for retailers who typically import nearly all the products for the major holiday shopping period in July, August and September.



U.S. consumers — Trump’s current tariffs cost a family of four about $800 more a year. Had he gone ahead with his threat to tax all remaining Chinese imports, a typical family’s costs would have more than doubled to over $1,800.



Huawei — The U.S. government has accused Chinese tech giant Huawei of using its phones and other products to basically spy on Americans. The Commerce Department had restricted U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei, but Trump relaxed the ban this weekend. It’s a big win for Huawei because Trump overruled some of his advisers — and even GOP senators — with the move. It also means Trump is willing to make Huawei part of the trade negotiations, something the Chinese wanted but some Trump advisers tried to keep separate because they argue doing business with Huawei presents a national security concern.



Wall Street — The stock market surged this month, with the Dow Jones industrial average having its best June since 1938. Wall Street investors bet Trump would restart trade talks, and that’s exactly what happened. Investors also cheered the Federal Reserve’s indication that it would cut interest rates, if necessary, to boost the economy if Trump’s trade war really starts to bite."
EH_Doc1_Trump-trade-war-China.docx,"Trump says trade war could go past 2020 election; China cancels U.S. farm visits 

His comments come after the U.S. granted exemptions on more than 400 Chinese products

Written By: Washington Post | Sep 20th 2019 - 5pm. 

WASHINGTON - The outlook for a near-term trade deal between the White House and China darkened on Friday, as President Donald Trump called China a ""threat to the world"" and dismissed the idea of an interim agreement the same day Chinese officials canceled a planned visits with farmers in Montana and Nebraska.

The combined news spooked investors, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average quickly lost 100 points, or around 0.4%.

Negotiations are set to continue, but the twin events on Friday suggested there is not an urgency on either side to complete an agreement.

At a press conference, Trump told reporters he was not under any pressure to complete a trade deal with China before the 2020 election, even though he has insisted in recent weeks that China wants to cut a deal with him to revive its economy. He also said he would hold out for a large, comprehensive agreement that has eluded the White House for more than a year. His comments appeared to defy the growing political and economic pressure for him to resolve the trade war soon.

""We're looking for a complete deal,"" Trump said. ""I'm not looking for a partial deal. We're looking for the big deal. We've taken it to this level.""

Trump often characterizes Chinese officials and their eagerness to reach a deal in a way that isn't consistent with the way Chinese officials talk about the talks. They have not expressed any urgency to resolve differences with the White House.

His comments were the latest in a series of sometimes contradictory signals about his approach with Beijing. In August, relations between the U.S. and China appeared to worsen markedly, but the mood had shifted in recent weeks and it appeared both sides were trying to reset talks. It's unclear, though, how well the talks are going. Chinese officials had planned to visit farmers in Montana next week, but that visit was canceled on Friday without any explanation.

Scott Kulbeck, director of membership services for the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, said he just received the news this morning and was not given information as to whether the delegation would reschedule.

""We didn't even get to the point where we were told what they wanted to discuss,"" Kulbeck said.

Similarly, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture learned Friday morning that meetings with a Chinese delegation had been canceled, said Christin Kamm, the department's public information officer. Kamm said she did not have any information as to why the Chinese canceled its visit to the state or whether the meeting would be rescheduled.

The U.S. and China are two of the world's largest economies, and Trump has alleged that China rips off U.S. consumers and businesses through unfair trade practices. He has insisted that they purchase more U.S. farm products, stop subsidizing businesses that compete with U.S. firms, and halt the theft of intellectual property from American companies, among other things."
Trump-Iran-Policy_Trump-approved economic sanctions against Iran hurt average Iranians.docx,"Tensions between the United States and Iran have reached their highest levels in decades after President Trump nearly called for a military strike against Iran last week. On Monday, the president signed off on new sanctions against the country. As the U.S. piles sanction after sanction on Iran, it's the average person who feels it the most.

From a subway performer's battered leather hat devoid of tips, to a bride-to-be's empty purse, the lack of cash from the economic pressure facing Iran's 80 million people can be seen everywhere. Many blame Mr. Trump and his maximalist policy on Iran, which has seen him pull out of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and levy punishing U.S. sanctions on the country.

In recent weeks, Iran has threatened to break out of the deal unless European powers mitigate what it calls Mr. Trump's ""economic warfare."" Iran also appeared ready to push back against the buildup of U.S. forces in the region, after shooting down an American drone it says violated its airspace last week. In response, U.S. officials have vowed to pile on more sanctions. The Pentagon conducted a cyberattack on computer systems in Iran that control rocket and missile launches, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. Mr. Trump reportedly approved the cyberattack.

But alongside Mr. Trump, many Iranians blame their own government. In 1979, Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini replaced the U.S. backed Monarchy of Mohammed Reza Shah after Iran voted by national referendum to become an Islamic Republic with Khomeini as ""Supreme Leader."" 

Walking by any money exchange shop is a dramatic reminder of the hardships most people are facing. Inflation is over 37 percent, according to government statistics. More than 3 million people, or 12 percent of working-age citizens, are unemployed. That rate doubles for educated youth. Depreciation and inflation make everything more expensive — from fruits and vegetables to tires and oil, all the way to the big-ticket items, like mobile phones. A simple cell phone is about two months' salary for the average government worker, while a single iPhone costs a 10 months' salary.

Iran is home to the world's fourth-largest proven reserve of crude oil and holds the world's second-largest proven reserve of natural gas, after Russia. But under Mr. Trump's maximum-pressure campaign, the U.S. has cut off Iran's ability to sell crude on the global market and threatened to sanction any nation that purchases it. Oil covers a third of the $80 billion a year the government spends in Iran, meaning that a fall in oil revenues cuts into its social welfare programs, as well as its military expenditures.

Years of popular frustration with failed economic policies triggered protests in late 2017, which early the following year spiraled into anti-government demonstrations across dozens of cities and towns. The current problems take root in Iran's faltering efforts to privatize its state-planned economy after the devastating war with Iraq in the 1980s, which saw 1 million people killed.

Still, many Iranians pin the economic crisis on corruption as much as anything else."
Obama_Border_Patrol_chief_to_Trump.docx,"Mark Morgan, a career FBI official who served as Border Patrol chief for the last six months of the Obama administration before being removed once President Trump took office, has come out this week in support of a border wall.

The morning after Trump reiterated in a prime-time address to the nation why wall funding was worth shutting down 25 percent of the federal government, Morgan told The Fix that he’s breaking his silence because, in his view, the wall is an important piece in a group of policy changes needed to secure the border.

When Morgan was pushed out in January 2017, it was reported that the Border Patrol union, which has been loyal to Trump and his policies since his candidacy, didn’t believe Morgan was making border security a priority and lobbied the administration for him to be replaced.

Morgan says now that some “wires got crossed” and that he had supported Trump’s call for a wall since “day one.” But during a congressional hearing, he was asked whether he supported “comprehensive immigration reform,” and he said, “yes.” What he meant, he says now, was a holistic approach to how immigrants come into the country, which would include a barrier, enhanced technology and more personnel, as well as more bed space in holding facilities, more immigration judges and aid to Central American countries to help them improve their quality of life. What he didn’t mean, and what many misinterpreted, was a path to citizenship or permanent status.

Echoing many of the GOP’s recent talking points, Morgan said he didn’t understand why Democrats supported a border fence in 2006 but now say a border wall is “immoral.”

Democrats have defended their support for the 700 miles of fencing that was constructed between the United States and Mexico as different from the 2,000 miles of concrete wall the president had originally proposed (he has since amended his offer to “steel slats”) and that the 2006 bill was a lesser of two evils compared with what Republicans really wanted, which was to charge any illegal immigrant as a felon.

On the former, Morgan said he doesn’t understand why politicians are arguing over the number of criminals or terrorists crossing the border — the Trump administration has been called out for claiming 4,000 terrorists were stopped at the southern border when the actual number is six. The goal, Morgan argued, shouldn’t be to wait for a single terrorist to come into the country, but to be proactive so that it doesn’t happen. Asked about the fact that more terrorists actually come into the country through the northern border with Canada, Morgan said issues there should be part of the conversation as well.

Democrats have said they are willing to have a debate over border security but not while unrelated agencies are being held for ransom by the shutdown. But Morgan said the shutdown is a necessary last stand for the president to force a solution to a problem that Washington has failed to fully address for decades."
CBB_Doc2_North-Korea-Standard.docx,"As North Korea fired off a series of missiles in recent months — at least 18 since May — President Trump has repeatedly dismissed their importance as short-range and “very standard” tests. And although he has conceded “there may be a United Nations violation,” the president says any concerns are overblown.

Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, Mr. Trump explained recently, just “likes testing missiles.”

Now, American intelligence officials and outside experts have come to a far different conclusion: that the launchings downplayed by Mr. Trump, including two late last month, have allowed Mr. Kim to test missiles with greater range and maneuverability that could overwhelm American defenses in the region.

Japan’s defense minister, Takeshi Iwaya, told reporters in Tokyo last week that the irregular trajectories of the most recent tests were more evidence of a program designed to defeat the defenses Japan has deployed, with American technology, at sea and on shore.

Mr. Kim’s flattery of Mr. Trump with beguiling letters and episodic meetings offering vague assurances of eventual nuclear disarmament, some outside experts say, are part of what they call the North Korean leader’s strategy of buying time to improve his arsenal despite all the sanctions on North Korea.



The rapid improvements in the short-range missiles not only put Japan and South Korea in increased danger, but also threaten at least eight American bases in those countries housing more than 30,000 troops, according to an analysis of the missile ranges by The New York Times. Such missiles, experts say, could be designed to carry either conventional or nuclear warheads.

“Kim is exploiting loopholes in his agreements with President Trump pretty brilliantly,” said Vipin Narang, a political-science professor at M.I.T. who studies North Korean weapon advances. “These are mobile-launched, they move fast, they fly very low and they are maneuverable. That’s a nightmare for missile defense. And it’s only a matter of time before those technologies are migrated to longer-range missiles.”

President Trump says that Mr. Kim committed to him during a meeting in Singapore 14 months ago that he would refrain from testing intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducting nuclear tests while negotiations are underway, and he has kept those promises even though there have been no substantive talks since a second summit in Hanoi in February resulted in an impasse.

But North Korean state-run media made clear last week that the country feels no such limits when it comes to improving other missile technologies, saying it would never accede to the West’s demand “for disarmament under pressure and appeasement of 

That was evident recently when Mr. Trump met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and once again dismissed the importance of the launches. Mr. Abe, usually an ardent supporter of Mr. Trump, immediately contradicted him, telling reporters that all of North Korea’s tests have violated United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Although Mr. Trump acknowledged that “there may be a United Nations violation,” he appears unwilling to make statements or take actions that could call into question what he considers his warm relationship with Mr. Kim, which the president believes is crucial to ending decades-long hostilities with the North."
Manufacturing-Jobs.docx,"Manufacturing Surge, a Boon for Trump, May Be Fading

For President Trump’s first two years in office, an unexpected rebound in manufacturing jobs helped bolster his claims that he was restoring the United States’ battered industrial sector. Now, that surge may be nearing its end — in part because of his own trade policies.

American manufacturers have added nearly half a million jobs since Mr. Trump took office, including for the last 19 months in a row. That streak, the longest since the mid-1990s, could hit 20 when the government releases March hiring data on Friday.

But concerns are mounting about how long that strength can continue. Employment growth for the sector in February, at 4,000 jobs, was the weakest in more than a year, and data from the payroll processing firm ADP on Wednesday showed the number of factory workers falling in March. Major automobile manufacturers have been cutting jobs; General Motors drew Mr. Trump’s ire last month when it idled a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, and eliminated 14,000 positions.

American manufacturers are being battered from all sides: by tariffs that are driving up their costs, by cooling growth in China and Europe that is hurting demand for their exports, and by the waning effects of the tax cuts and government spending increases that pumped up growth last year. Data from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed that orders for capital goods, a key measure of business investment, fell in February and have trended down since last summer.

 “We should expect to see manufacturing growth slow quite significantly,” said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics, a research firm.

American factories aren’t grinding to a halt. A closely watched survey from the Institute of Supply Management hit a three-year low in February but rebounded somewhat in March. Recent data from China suggests that the government’s efforts to stimulate the economy there are beginning to have an effect. And financial markets rallied Wednesday, and continued to rise Thursday, on hopes that the United States and China could be nearing a trade deal. Strong economic underpinnings — low unemployment, rising wages, high levels of consumer confidence — make an outright collapse in manufacturing unlikely.

At Gradall Industries, an Ohio manufacturer of excavators and other heavy equipment for the manufacturing industry, orders have been strong this year, according to Michael A. Haberman, the company’s president. But business in China is down sharply, tariffs are driving up costs, and Mr. Haberman has given up on the infrastructure spending package he hoped would spur demand for Gradall’s equipment.

“Obviously, Europe’s not doing that well, and China is clearly in a slowdown, so there has to be a concern,” he said.

Faced with that uncertainty, Mr. Haberman wavered before making a long-needed investment in a new robot welder this year. He eventually went ahead with that purchase, but he has postponed other investments — lasers for steel cutting, new machining equipment, additional robot welders.

“You need certainty if you’re going to spend that kind of money,” he said. “And I don’t think anybody feels very comfortable.”"
A Republican senator close to President Donald Trump on Sunday backed a temporary re.docx,"A Republican senator close to President Donald Trump on Sunday backed a temporary re-opening of the federal government, in the 23rd day of the longest shutdown ever, to allow for talks on a spending agreement that could satisfy Trump’s border security demands.



Democrats in Congress rejected Trump’s request that legislation to fund the government include $5.7 billion of taxpayer money for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. They have refused further negotiations until the government is reopened after being partially shut down since Dec. 22. 



Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he urged the president on Sunday to reopen the government for a limited period to try to get talks going again. 



If no progress is made, he said, then Trump should declare a national emergency as a way to get money to build his wall, a plan not popular with some fellow Republicans.



“Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug (to) see if we can get a deal,” Graham said on “Fox News Sunday.” 



He said Trump told him, “Let’s make a deal, then open up the government.” 

The record shutdown has furloughed 800,000 federal employees and cut government services across the United States. They missed their first paychecks on Friday, heightening concerns about mounting financial pressures on employees, including air traffic controllers and airport security officials who are working without pay. 



Trump continued to blame Democrats for the impasse. “I’m in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!” Trump said Sunday on Twitter. 

Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, responded on Twitter that, “Speaker Pelosi has been in DC all weekend working from the Capitol.” 



In a meeting last month with Pelosi and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, Trump said he would be “proud” to shut down the government over wall funding. Recent polls show most Americans think the president is to blame.

Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, said she believes Trump and Republicans will lose the game of chicken as furloughed workers, airport travelers, tourists and others “experience the consequences of political dysfunction firsthand.” 



“The shutdown is real. The wall is hypothetical. And at some point soon, the Republicans are going to remember that it’s real people in their districts who aren’t getting paid, real people who aren’t able to access government services, and real people who vote,” she said. 



A concourse at Miami International Airport was shut down for part of the weekend because not enough Transportation Security Administration agents were present to staff all of the airport’s the security checkpoints.



The airport said it would reopen the concourse on Monday and “continue to monitor checkpoint staffing levels and make adjustments as necessary.” 

Working without pay, TSA employees have been calling in sick in increasing numbers since the shutdown began."
Trump_walks_out_of_border_security_meeting_after_Pelosi_rejects_wall_pitch.docx,"President Trump walked out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday afternoon over the partial government shutdown after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi again rejected supporting new funding for a border wall, according to those in the meeting.

Speaking to reporters after the brief session, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the “president just got up and walked out.""

“He asked Speaker Pelosi, ‘will you agree to my wall?’ She said no. And he just got up, and said, 'Well we’ve got nothing to discuss,'"" Schumer said.

The president, in a tweet, called the meeting “a total waste of time” and appeared to confirm that he left after Pelosi's answer.

“I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!” Trump tweeted.

Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!

Pelosi, D-Calif., said after the meeting that the president was “petulant."" Schumer said Trump slammed his hand on a table in frustration, but Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans, speaking to reporters afterward, denied that happened.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the president was willing to make a deal in the meeting.

""I just listened to Senator Schumer,” McCarthy, a California Republican, said. “I know he complained the time that you had cameras in the meeting. I think we need to bring them back. Because what he described the meeting to be is totally different than what took place.""

The meeting in the Situation Room on Wednesday afternoon came ahead of Trump’s planned trip to the Texas-Mexico border on Thursday. Earlier, the president traveled to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Republicans, saying afterward, “We have a very unified party.”

AS TRUMP HEADS TO BORDER, DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON ‘MANUFACTURED CRISIS’ CLAIM

Still, a growing number of moderate Republicans - like Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado -- have appeared uncomfortable with the toll the partial shutdown is taking.

Trump has said he might declare a national emergency and try to authorize the wall on his own if Congress won't approve the $5.7 billion he's asking.

""I think we might work a deal, and if we don't I might go that route,"" he said.

TRUMP SAYS HE HAS 'ABSOLUTE RIGHT' TO DECLARE NATIONAL EMERGENCY OVER BORDER SECURITY

Past meetings with Democrats have resulted in both sides digging in, with Trump insisting on nearly $6 billion for a border wall and Democrats saying they won’t entertain the discussion until Congress passes and Trump signs a package re-opening shuttered federal agencies."
Trump-Pushes-Wall.docx,"Trump Pushes For Wall Amid Shutdown, Says There's 'A Crisis Of The Heart' At Border

President Trump made his case to the American people Tuesday night for why a massive wall along the Mexican border is necessary, using his first Oval Office address to outline his conditions for ending the 18-day-and-counting partial government shutdown.

""This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,"" Trump said, explaining why his request for $5.7 billion to build the wall and for additional border security measures is necessary.

""The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. ... The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government,"" the president said.

Trump's address Tuesday night seemed, at least in part, a way to reassure nervous Republicans about the political cost of the shutdown, some of whom may be wavering as more impacts from the partial closure of the government ripple across the country. Trump and Vice President Pence will meet with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, and on Thursday Trump will visit the border to continue his media blitz. But in the nearly three-week-long shutdown, there still is no clear path to a resolution anytime soon, as both Trump and Democratic congressional leaders in their rebuttal offered nothing new beyond the arguments they've been making since last month.

Unlike at his campaign rallies, Trump didn't begin his Oval Office address with his push for a wall. Instead, he first outlined what he says is an urgent need to address a growing number of migrants trying to cross the border and to address drugs coming across illegally.

""Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system,"" Trump said.

Trump also claimed that the ""Southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs"" and that it was necessary to ""stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers.""

However, an NPR fact check found that according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs come through legal ports of entry and only a small fraction comes through parts of the Southern border that would be impacted by a wall.

Trump also tried to make an emotional plea, pointing as he often has to crimes and slayings committed by undocumented immigrants as another reason stricter border security is necessary.

""How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?"" Trump asked, framing his argument as ""a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.""

However, studies show undocumented immigrants in the U.S. commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans."
Trump_Has_Lost_Ground_In_The_Shutdown_Blame_Game.docx,"President Trump again blamed Democrats for the partial government shutdown on Tuesday night, this time in his first primetime national address, saying their unwillingness to approve funds for a border wall had left him no choice but to continue to keep the government shuttered.
Look at the polling data, and you can see why Trump (or his advisers) thought a high-profile move like a national address was needed. We’re currently on Day 19 of the shutdown, but Trump’s efforts to pin the blame on Democrats aren’t working, according to three pollsters who have conducted at least two polls in the two and a half weeks since the government first closed. Rather, polls show that Americans are increasingly blaming Trump.


Polls conducted in the first few days of the shutdown showed that between 43 percent and 47 percent of Americans blamed Trump most for the shutdown, while about a third blamed congressional Democrats. Polling data had been pretty scarce thereafter, but this week a handful of new polls gave us an updated view of who Americans think is responsible. (We’re looking only at data from pollsters who have conducted two surveys since the shutdown started — one just after it began and one after the new year. This makes for nice apples-to-apples comparisons.)

The two YouGov polls found a 4-point increase in those blaming Trump. There was a 4-point increase among registered voters who most blamed Trump in the two Morning Consult polls. And surveys from Reuters/Ipsosalso found a 4-point increase.



As for where Democrats stand in the blame-game, Morning Consult found a 2-point increase in those who blame them the most between their two polls, while Ipsos/Reuters found a 1-point drop and YouGov found a 3-point drop.

Those aren’t huge shifts, but remember that the shutdown began with most Americans blaming Trump — that view is held among a near-majority now, on average.


Still, when it comes to how each group is handling the shutdown, congressional Republicans actually fare the worst. In the most recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, for example — conducted Jan. 4-7 — more Americans disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown (52 percent) than they did of the way Democrats were handling it (46 percent), but 56 percent of Americans expressed disapproval of the congressional GOP’s performance.


There is some good news for Trump. His base seems to largely blame Democrats for the current situation. Seventy-three percent of those who voted for him in 2016 say Democrats are mostly to blame in the shutdown, according to the most recent Morning Consult poll. 

Eighty-three percent of Trump voters blamed Democrats in the most recent YouGov poll.2 And however the blame shakes out for this shutdown, government shutdowns historically have not had lasting political repercussions, so Trump may weather this latest political maelstrom just fine.
That said, for now the shutdown appears to be hurting Trump. His job approval rating has edged down in the past three weeks — a trend that lines up almost perfectly on the calendar with the shutdown."
It-May-Take .docx,"It may take federal officials two years to identify what could be thousands of immigrant children who were separated from their families at the border, the government said in court documents filed on Friday.



A federal judge had asked for a plan to identify these children and their families after a report from government inspectors in January revealed that the Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents.



These families were separated before the administration unveiled its “zero-tolerance” immigration policy in the spring of 2018, when nearly all adults entering the country illegally were prosecuted and any children accompanying them were put into shelters or foster care.



To identify these families, the government said it would apply a statistical analysis to about 47,000 children who were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and subsequently discharged, according to the court filing. From there, the government said it would manually review the case records of the children who appeared to have the highest probability of being part of the separated families.



Officials estimated that the process would take at least one year and potentially two. In explaining the reason for such an arduous process, the government said United States Customs and Border Protection did not collect specific data on migrant family separations before April 2018.



In a court filing for the government, Jonathan White, a commander with the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, wrote that identifying this group of children presented new challenges because they were already discharged from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, meaning the government “lacks access” to them.



In June, Judge Dana M. Sabraw ordered the reunification of children and parents who had been separated under the Trump administration policy. President Trump rescinded the policy that same month.



About 2,800 children have been reunified with their families or situated according to their parents’ wishes, said Lee Gelernt, who challenged the policy in court on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.



The January report, by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, revealed that a group of separated families was unaccounted for because the government lacked an effective tracking system. In March, Judge Sabraw ruled that those families should be included in the litigation.



The families the government may now be tasked with locating are those who entered the United States on or after July 1, 2017, the earliest known date that families were separated; were detained by immigration officials; and have a child who was detained and then released to a sponsor, such as a relative, before the judge’s reunification order on June 26, 2018.



When the government previously identified children for reunification, it included only the children who were detained at the time of the reunification order.



According to the government’s proposed plan, officials would update the A.C.L.U. about the families’ information after completing the analysis and reviewing the children’s cases. The organization would then use that information to help reunify parents and children.



The family separations were a central part of the Trump administration’s effort to deter migrant families from trying to enter the United States through its southern border with Mexico.



Data released last month suggested that the administration’s immigration measures failed to deter tens of thousands of migrants traveling to the United States, most of whom were escaping violence and poverty in Central America."
Fed-Interest-Rates.docx,"Powell gets the heat, but all Trump Fed appointees backed rate hikes

U.S. President Donald Trump may feel he is “stuck” with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he has blasted for engineering four interest rate hikes since Trump appointed him, but none of Trump’s other Fed appointees has stood in the way of the tightening campaign and at least one has said even higher rates may be necessary.

The voting records and public statements of Trump’s Fed appointees, who now form a solid majority of the Fed’s Washington-based board of governors, show not only consensus around the recent increases, but no support so far for the rate cuts Trump has demanded.

A possible upcoming nominee to the Fed, economic commentator Stephen Moore, has said he agrees with Trump that rates should be cut and had earlier called for Powell’s ouster. Trump has mulled whether he could fire Powell, but in a March 8 phone call, reported by the Wall Street Journal, acknowledged he was “stuck” with the Fed chair for Powell’s full four-year term that runs to February 2022.

If Moore does take a seat alongside Trump’s appointees at the Fed, at this point he would be the outlier.

“I am comfortable with the current stance of our policy,” Trump’s newest appointee, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, said in February in her only comments about monetary policy to date.

Bowman joined the Fed in November, when the administration was growing agitated about rising volatility in financial markets. She voted for the December rate increase that has become a particular target of Trump’s ire and point of blame for, in his view, holding back the economy.

The White House on Tuesday announced Bowman would be renominated for a full 14-year term to follow the end next January of the short, partial term she was appointed to fill.

Trump’s hand-picked vice chair, Richard Clarida, voted for the December increase and the one before it in September, which was approved shortly after he joined the Fed board.

Randal Quarles, who was the first appointment Trump made to the Fed as his presidency took shape in 2017, voted for five rates hikes from December of that year to December 2018, and his most recent comments show the wide and sometimes paradoxical gap between the president’s view of what the Fed should be doing, and those of the people he has chosen to oversee the central bank.

In what amounted to a bullish defense of where the economy is heading, Quarles last week said in fact that rates may need to move higher precisely because Trump’s tax cuts and policies may produce a “persistent” boost to productivity and growth.

“Further increases in the policy rate may be necessary at some point, a stance I believe is consistent with my optimistic view of the economy’s growth potential and momentum,” Quarles said in remarks at the Manhattan Institute last week.

For now the Fed intends to hold rates steady, a position it reached both as Trump publicly called for a halt to rate increases, but also - and what Fed officials say mattered to them - as economic and financial data globally indicated a broad slowdown from the faster-than-expected growth of 2018."
ERM_Doc2_As-Washington-Talks.docx,"As Washington Talks Impeachment, Pence Talks Trade 

Vice president spent two days mostly avoiding questions on the topic that is dominating politics 

By 

Catherine Lucey

Sept. 28, 2019 10:00 am ET

With the impeachment process roiling Washington and enraging his boss, Vice President Mike Pence headed to Indiana and tried to change the subject.

During a two-day trip to his home state, the scandal-averse second-in-command studiously avoided media questions about Ukraine, an explosive whistleblower complaint and the House’s impeachment inquiry into President Trump.

Departing from Andrews Air Force Base on Thursday, Mr. Pence walked up the stairs without stopping. Upon landing in Indiana, he bypassed a reporter and shook hands with supporters. Entering a school to sign a guitar and visit with kids, he strode on with the questions hanging in the air. Sitting at a roundtable discussion in a hospital, he smiled and stared straight ahead. And returning to Washington, he got into a car and drove away.

Such caution comes naturally to Mr. Pence, who is as scripted as Mr. Trump is unstructured. But he now faces the most serious scandal to grip this administration to date, as Mr. Trump contends with impeachment proceedings over his dealings with Ukraine. As vice president, Mr. Pence could succeed Mr. Trump if he is impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate.

In Indiana, Mr. Pence tried to reframe the narrative. He talked about trade, advocating for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. He talked about investing in mental health. He sought to inspire children and lift up troops. The closest he came to acknowledging the state of play was in a speech Thursday, in which he slammed Democrats for focusing on “baseless allegations.”

“Whatever the Democrats and their allies want to spend their time on, President Donald Trump and I are going to stay focused on the issues that matter most to you,” Mr. Pence said.

On Twitter late in the day Friday, Mr. Pence repeated that argument, adding that Democrats “began an impeachment inquiry before they even had the facts.”

The vice president’s chief of staff, Marc Short, described the vice president’s approach as a deliberate strategy to keep the focus on issues, saying the vice president was “going to highlight things that aren’t getting done by a Democrat-led House.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has said the chamber can continue working on important legislation even as it pursues impeachment, which she called “as serious as our congressional responsibilities can be” Friday on “Morning Joe.” And Democrats lay the blame for slow progress on several issues at the feet of Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump, unlike his understudy, spent the day venting about impeachment on Twitter, defending his July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine, in which he pushed for an investigation into Joe Biden and his son. The vice president wasn’t a part of the call, said a senior White House official.

Mr. Pence defended Mr. Trump’s conversation in an interview on Fox Business Network on Wednesday, saying the president “did nothing wrong.”"
CJR_Doc1_Whistleblower-Testify-Soon.docx,"The whistleblower at the center of the impeachment probe of President Trump will testify in the House “very soon,” though in a way that will protect his identity, the Democrat leading the probe said Sunday.



The whistleblower, whose identity hasn’t been made public, works for the Central Intelligence Agency, The Wall Street Journal confirmed last week.



“We’ll get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman, said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We are taking all the precautions” to protect his identity, Mr. Schiff added.



President Trump’s personal attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, initially said on the same program that he wouldn’t cooperate with Mr. Schiff’s probe, accusing the congressman of lacking fairness.



But Mr. Giuliani quickly changed his position, saying he would consider testifying. “I have to be guided by my client,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Frankly, it’s his privilege, not mine. If he decides he wants me to testify I will testify.”



Mr. Giuliani is a key figure in the impeachment probe and is depicted in the whistleblower complaint released Thursday as eager to thrust himself into U.S. foreign policy. As the president’s personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani pressed Ukraine on pursuing an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden."
Government Shutdown Unemployment Claims.docx,"Whatever It Takes': Government Workers Apply For Unemployment As Shutdown Drags On

LISTEN

PATRICK MADDEN, January 13, 20197:43 AM ET

Long-time federal contractor John Woodson arrived at an unemployment office in Washington, D.C. early Thursday morning. 

""We should still be at work right now,"" said Woodson. ""Politicians should handle this — don't put this on the citizens. You're hurting us.""Even if Woodson can get unemployment, which pays up to $425 a week in D.C., he says it won't be enough to care for his family.

Federal workers and contractors are now missing paychecks for the first time since the partial government shutdown began on December 22. That's causing some of these workers to do what once seemed unthinkable — apply for unemployment.

""The reason that I chose a public sector job was the stability of the whole thing,"" said Steve, a federal employee who also showed up to a D.C. unemployment office. 

Steve said he left a higher-paying job in the private sector to work for the government. ""The real benefit was a job that I felt appreciated at — a job that had stability,"" said Steve. ""And right now, I feel unappreciated and unstable,"" he said.

Officials in D.C. and Maryland say at least 7,000 unemployment claims have been filed by federal government workers and contractors since the shutdown began. In all, some 800,000 employees have been affected by the shutdown. An estimated 420,000 are working without pay, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Another 380,000 are at home on furlough.

""This is the first time in my working life I am going to have to go to my creditors and say 'I don't know how to pay you.' And it's embarrassing,"" said Michelle, a long-time federal employee who didn't want to give her full name because she's worried about potential repercussions.

""I show up to work. I do a good job. I'm doing everything a responsible adult is supposed to do,"" said Michelle. ""All of a sudden, it's all blown up and I don't know what else to do.""

According to the federal government, the shutdown will cost at least $50 million a day in lost wages and productivity.

But there are hidden costs, too, that go beyond money, said Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees.

""Who in [the] world is going to want to work for the federal government when [workers] are disrespected ... when people are not able to fill prescriptions, bouncing checks [and] ruining their credit?"" said Erwin, whose union represents 100,000 federal workers.

The details surrounding who is — and isn't — eligible for unemployment can get complicated.

Federal employees who've been furloughed can apply for unemployment benefits; workers who've been deemed ""essential"" and are working without pay are not eligible for unemployment.

And federal employees who do receive unemployment benefits will have to reimburse the government if Congress votes to give employees backpay — which typically happens when the government re-opens.

Federal contractors don't get backpay from the government.

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance for furloughed workers on what to do during a shutdown."
The Real Problem with Immigration.docx,"The Real Problem

Illegal immigration into the United States is massive in scale. More than 10 million undocumented aliens currently reside in the U.S., and that population is growing by 700,000 per year. On one hand, the presence of so many aliens is a powerful testament to the attractiveness of America. On the other hand, it is a sign of how dangerously open our borders are.


Typical illegal aliens come to America primarily for better jobs and in the process add value to the U.S. economy. However, they also take away value by weakening the legal and national security environment. When three out of every 100 people in America are undocumented (or, rather, documented with forged and faked papers), there is a profound security problem. Even though they pose no direct security threat, the presence of millions of undocumented migrants distorts the law, distracts resources, and effectively creates a cover for terrorists and criminals.

In other words, the real problem presented by illegal immigration is security, not the supposed threat to the economy. Indeed, efforts to curtail the economic influx of migrants actually worsen the security dilemma by driving many migrant workers underground, thereby encouraging the culture of illegality. A non-citizen guest worker program is an essential component of securing the border, but only if it is the right program.


It is important to craft a guest worker program intelligently. While there are numerous issues involved in such a program, many of which are beyond the scope of this paper, the evidence indicates that worker migration is a net plus economically. With this in mind, there are 14 principles- with an eye toward the economic incentives involved-that should be included as part of a guest worker program.


An honest assessment acknowledges that illegal immigrants bring real benefits to the supply side of the American economy, which is why the business community is opposed to a simple crackdown. There are economic costs as well, given America's generous social insurance institutions. The cost of securing the border would logically exist regardless of the number of immigrants.


The argument that immigrants harm the American economy should be dismissed out of hand. The population today includes a far higher percentage (12 percent) of foreign-born Americans than in recent decades, yet the economy is strong, with higher total gross domestic product (GDP), higher GDP per person, higher productivity per worker, and more Americans working than ever before. Immigration may not have caused this economic boom, but it is folly to blame immigrants for hurting the economy at a time when the economy is simply not hurting. As Stephen Moore pointed out in a recent article in The Wall Street Journal:

The increase in the immigration flow has corresponded with steady and substantial reductions in unemployment from 7.3 percent to 5.1 percent over the past two decades. And the unemployment rates have fallen by 6 percentage points for blacks and 3.5 percentage points for Latinos. Whether low-skilled or high-skilled, immigrants boost national output, enhance specialization, and provide a net economic benefit."
Memo-Muller-Obstruction.docx,"It is inconceivable to me that the Department could accept Mueller's interpretation of § 1512(c)(2). It is untenable as a matter of law and cannot provide a legitimate basis for interrogating the President. I know you will agree that, if a DOI investigation is going to take down a democratically-elected President, it is imperative to the health of our system and to our national cohesion that any claim of wrongdoing is solidly based on evidence of a real crime — not a debatable one. It is time to travel well-worn paths; not to veer into novel, unsettled or contested areas of the law; and not to indulge the fancies by overly-zealous prosecutors.



As elaborated on below, Mueller's theory should be rejected for the following reasons:



First, the sweeping interpretation being proposed for § 1512's residual clause is contrary to the statute's plain meaning and would directly contravene the Department's longstanding and consistent position that generally-worded statutes like § 1512 cannot be applied to the President's exercise of his constitutional powers in the absence of a ""clear statement"" in the statute that such an application was intended.



Second, Mueller's premise that, whenever an investigation touches on the President's own conduct, it is inherently ""corrupt"" under § 1512 for the President to influence that matter is insupportable. In granting plenary law enforcement powers to the President, the Constitution places no such limit on the President's supervisory authority. Moreover, such a limitation cannot be reconciled with the Department's longstanding position that the ""conflict of interest"" laws do not, and cannot, apply to the President, since to apply them would impermissibly ""disempower"" the President from supervising a class of cases that the Constitution grants him the authority to supervise.



Third, defining facially-lawful exercises of Executive discretion as potential crimes, based solely on subjective motive, would violate Article II of the Constitution by impermissibly burdening the exercise of core discretionary powers within the Executive branch.



Fourth, even if one were to indulge Mueller's obstruction theory, in the particular circumstances here, the President's motive in removing Carney and commenting on Flynn could not have been ""corrupt"" unless the President and his campaign were actually guilty of illegal collusion. Because the obstruction claim is entirely dependent on first finding collusion, Mueller should not be permitted to interrogate the President about obstruction until has enough evidence to establish collusion."
Government Shutdown Across America.docx,"Government Shutdown Across  America By Alan Blinder, Jan. 13, 2019

From the start, it has seemed like the federal government shutdown with no end in sight. More than three weeks later, with Washington still gridlocked over President Trump’s demand for a wall along the southwestern border, that is still true.

But the sharpest effects of the longest shutdown in the nation’s 242-year history are only beginning to emerge across the country. In many parts of the United States, the shutdown has underscored how deeply the federal government is connected to everyday life.

About 800,000 federal workers are going without pay — and a growing number of them, are filing for unemployment benefits. Thousands more federal contractors will most likely not be able to recoup their missed paychecks. Restaurants and shops near major federal offices, have emptied out.



So have laboratories run by NASA and the Smithsonian Institution’s museums along the National Mall. Food inspections have become fewer, as have many checks by the Environmental Protection Agency. Travelers have complained that airport security lines, have come to a crawl. Trash has piled up at National Park Service sites, or at least those that are still open.

Native American tribes have missed out on millions of dollars in federal funding for basic services, farmers have been squeezed by issues with loans and payments, and states have written checks to keep some services and properties, like the Statue of Liberty, running normally. The federal courts have hung on so far, with a goal of saving enough money to run as they ordinarily do through Jan. 18.

Congress recently approved a proposal that promised back pay for federal workers affected by the shutdown. But their checks will come only once Washington reaches a deal. Until then, the consequences will mount from coast to coast.



Border protection: Customs and Border Protection agents, who are working without pay, deported individuals as others waited to cross into the United States on the McAllen-Hidalgo International Bridge in Texas.



Food safety: Meat and poultry inspections have continued by the Department of Agriculture. But foods such as produce, processed cheese and cereals may not be inspected as often as the Food and Drug Administration deals with a reduced inspection workforce.



Homeland Security: A Coast Guard boat responded after the Mary B II, a commercial fishing vessel, capsized off the coast of Newport, Ore.



T.S.A.: Transportation Security Administration screeners at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington will be paid once the shutdown ends, but many say they are struggling to pay bills in the meantime.



Farmers: Despite the loss of crucial loans, payments and other services, threatening their livelihoods, many farmers, including David Nunnery, 59, of Pike County, Miss., have stayed loyal to Mr. Trump and his demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall. “I may lose the farm, but I strongly feel we need some border security,” Mr. Nunnery said.



Presidential protection: Secret Service agents, including those who protect President Trump, are working without pay, according to an official at the agency.



National parks: Visitors to Yosemite National Park arrived below Bridalveil Fall, where a consortium of private businesses, civic groups and concessionaires banded together and placed portable toilets after the regular bathrooms were locked because of the shutdown."
Trump_ Immigration_policy.docx,"President Trump is delaying immigration raids that were set to begin this weekend, saying he will give Congress two weeks to make changes to asylum law before dispatching Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents around the country to deport undocumented immigrants.

Immigration rights advocates had been preparing for the planned sweep of recently arrived migrants, which, according to sources familiar with the planned raids, were set to begin as soon as Sunday in 10 cities around the country. 

A source familiar with the president's decision told NPR that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump on Friday night and urged him to back off the raids. Pelosi had been sharply critical of the planned raids. She called them heartless and said the president needed ""to stop this brutal action which will tear families apart and inject terror into our communities.""

On Saturday, the president announced on Twitter that ICE would hold off on the roundup for two weeks ""at the request of Democrats,"" writing that if lawmakers in Washington cannot approve changes to asylum law in that time, he will again direct ICE agents to resume the raids.

Sources close to the White House say Democrats are unlikely to accept Trump's pitch that asylum rules should be tightened. 

Both parties are working to pass a border aid package to help deal with the influx of migrants arriving illegally at the border, and a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill noted that the raids could have endangered the deal had they not been put on pause. 

The $4.5 billion border and humanitarian supplemental assistance package has been moving along with bipartisan support. Much of the money supports humanitarian assistance and immigration enforcement. 

But by asking Congress to address asylum and ""loophole problems,"" Trump is upping the ante. There is no funding for changes to asylum laws, so Trump's request faces significant hurdles. 

Pelosi on Saturday welcomed the president's announcement delaying the planned raids. She called for a comprehensive immigration package that includes a path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million people who are in the country illegally. 

ICE sent letters in February to more than 2,000 migrants whose cases the Justice Department fast-tracked as a way of sending a deterrent message to families considering crossing the U.S. border illegally. 

""If Congress does not change the laws to ensure illegal aliens can be promptly removed at the southern border, there is no alternative but to continuously arrest these fugitive aliens in the interior,"" a spokeswoman for ICE said in a statement on Saturday. 

In an interview with NPR, Acting ICE Director Mark Morgan said many immigrant families are ignoring requests to turn themselves in. 

""So what are our options?"" Morgan said. ""They've had due process, they've had access to attorneys, they've had access to interpreters. Majority of them don't even show up. And then when they didn't show up, they received ordered removal in absentia,"" he said. ""We have no choice.""

Immigration activists have condemned the raids and implored the Trump administration to call them off."
The-Trump-Administration .docx,"The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year, a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody.



The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47,000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1, 2017 and June 25, 2018 — the day before U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families. The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation — for example, children under 5.



The administration would provide information on separated families on a rolling basis to the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to reunite families and criticized the proposed timeline on Saturday.



Sabraw ordered last year that more than 2,700 children in government care on June 26, 2018 be reunited with their families, which has largely been accomplished. Then, in January, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s internal watchdog reported that thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017. The department’s inspector general said the precise number was unknown.



The judge ruled last month that he could hold the government accountable for families that were separated before his June order and asked the government submit a proposal for the next steps. A hearing is scheduled April 16.



Sheer volume makes the job different than identifying children who were in custody at the time of the judge’s June order, Jonathan White, a commander of the U.S. Public Health Service and Health and Human Services’ point person on family reunification, said in an affidavit.



White, whose work has drawn strong praise from the judge, would lead the effort to identify additional families on behalf of Health and Health and Human Services with counterparts at Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement. Dr. Barry Graubard, a statistics expert at the National Cancer Institute, developed a system to flag for early attention those most likely to have been separated.



The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives, but many are not parents. Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year, 49 percent went to parents, 41 percent to close relatives such as an aunt, uncle, grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives, family friends and others.



The government’s proposed model to flag still-separated children puts a higher priority on the roughly half who were not released to a parent. Other signs of likely separation include children under 5, younger children traveling without a sibling and those who were detained in the Border Patrol’s El Paso, Texas, sector, where the administration ran a trial program that involved separating nearly 300 family members from July to November 2017.



Saturday marks the anniversary of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally from Mexico. The administration retreated in June amid an international uproar by generally exempting adults who come with their children. The policy now applies only to single adults."
David Williams Week 1 File 1.docx,"(CNN)It's always a challenge to understand why Donald Trump says and does things. He is a hugely impulsive figure who often acts on a whim. There is no long-term strategy that informs his daily tactical decisions -- just Trump, well, doing stuff.

But even by that haphazard standard, the President's decision this week to release a rough transcript of his July 25 conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky makes zero political sense -- either in the moment he did it or in the after-action report.





The rough log of the call makes quite clear to any fair-minded person that Trump did the following things:

1) Repeatedly reminded Zelensky of how much the United States does (and can do) for Ukraine.

2) Asked Zelensky to investigate debunked allegations of corrupt activity by Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine





3) Said he would put Attorney General William Barr and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani in touch with Zelensky to follow up about the Biden probe.

That's not an interpretation of what Trump said or a second-hand account of the call. It is an, admittedly rough, transcript released (and presumably blessed) by the White House. In which the President of the United States says things like ""I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time"" and ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me."" (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.)

That we have the President's actual words here -- undisputed -- makes this whole matter so, so much worse for Trump. 



Top of Form

Bottom of Form

That's not this. In this case, we have the receipts -- even if what was released by the White House was not a full transcript but rather a sort of rough memo documenting the conversation between Trump and Zelensky. It's a primary source document that, uh, documents a clear use of pressure by Trump to get Zelensky to do what he wants.

As he often does, Trump has doubled/tripled/quadrupled down on his initial mistake.



 

""'IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!'"" Trump tweeted Friday morning -- apparently quoting himself and in ALL CAPS, no less! Later on Friday, he added: ""If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn't considered appropriate, then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!""

The number of tweets -- and the amount of defensiveness contained therein -- would suggest to even the most armchair of psychologists that the President might well be overcompensating for something he now realizes he very, very much should not have done.

As I wrote when the Ukraine call was initially released, it reads pretty close to a smoking gun that Trump used the power of his office to further his own personal, political interests. (If you are arguing that Trump didn't say the words ""quid pro quo"" so, therefore, he is in the clear, well, OK.)"
Trump Approval Rating With Base Drops Amid Shutdown.docx,"It’s day 27 of the government shutdown, and a new NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll suggests that Trump’s base is losing faith. Over the last month, Trump’s approval rating has dropped to 39 percent overall, a trend driven by losses in demographics where he is typically strong. Forty-two percent of white suburban men say they approve of the president’s performance, down from 51 percent in December. White men without college degrees have always been more likely to support Trump, but the president’s approval rating declined by six points among this group. Even white Evangelicals, typically Trump’s most fervent supporters, are beginning to break away from him. Seventy-three percent approved of Trump in December, but 66 percent said the same in January — and only 58 percent said they would “definitely” vote for him again in 2020. In 2016, recall, Trump won 81 percent of the white Evangelical vote.

These attitudes may change as primary season moves forward. Trump remains vitriolically anti-immigration, and xenophobia is attractive to his base. Even so, Trump has a lot of ground to recover before he can feel secure about the fate of his reelection campaign. That his numbers dropped so precipitously over the course of one month suggests the shutdown is a contributing factor (though, of course, correlation is not causation). Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, told NPR that he didn’t know if the numbers are “temporary — tied to the government shutdown — or a broader problem the president is having.”

We do know, however, that little else about the first two years of Trump’s presidency has dismayed his base. The separation of migrant children from their parents, his border-wall obsession, revelations from the Mueller investigation — it was all fine, even better than fine, to his most dogged supporters. But the president ran on his business prowess. His anti-immigrant prejudice gilded promises of jobs and prosperity (at least, for a deserving few). White Evangelicals, for example, didn’t all support Trump because they prioritized ideological control of the U.S. Supreme Court. One 2016 poll from Lifeway Research, a Christian firm, established a demarcation between the views of white Evangelical clergy from those of their parishioners. While both groups backed Trump, clergy were much more likely to say that their votes were motivated by the prospect of conservative Supreme Court nominees. Non-clergy prioritized both the economy and national security over either the Supreme Court and abortion.

Unemployment is currently low, but in other respects, the Trump presidency has been economically disastrous for workers. The government shutdown has now cost the average federal worker $5,000 in pay since it began, according to one analysis by the New York Times. Some federal workers and subcontractors are rationing insulin and crowdfunding their mortgages. The U.S. Coast Guard is serving without pay, too. And shutdowns don’t affect the federal workforce in isolation. The owners of one Wichita, Kansas, cafe told the HuffPost that many of their customers are federal workers, and the furlough has drastically reduced their clientele."
CBB_Doc1_Trump-North-Korea.docx,"Two months after President Trump shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Korean demilitarized zone, his administration remains stymied in its efforts to coax Pyongyang back to the negotiating table, leading to mounting frustrations that time is running out while Kim has strengthened his position.

In a new letter to Trump on Friday, leading Senate Democrats are calling the North’s recent short-range-missile tests “a significant step backwards” and demanding that the United States hold Kim’s regime accountable for actions that “clearly contravene” U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post.

A leading Washington think tank concluded in a public assessment published Friday that an undisclosed North Korean operating base in Kumchon-ni houses medium-range ballistic missiles capable of striking southern Japan as well as the outskirts of Tokyo.

And the State Department, whose efforts to engage North Korean diplomats have floundered, is weighing new steps to publicly pressure the Kim regime during the U.N. General Assembly in New York this month, said officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations.

The developments stand in sharp contrast to Trump’s efforts in recent weeks to play down friction with the North in an effort to maintain a personal relationship with Kim that has driven his un­or­tho­dox strategy to force one of the world’s most brutal and dangerous regimes to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.

“The president is increasingly isolated within his own government on this policy,” said Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), whose program published the assessment of the Kumchon-ni facility.

Cha noted Trump said last month that he had received a letter from Kim suggesting talks would resume after the completion of annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which ended two weeks ago.

“I sense a lot of frustration that nothing is going on,” Cha said of the president’s aides. “They promised in August that these things would happen.”

White House officials declined to comment.

Kim has unsettled East Asia this summer with tests of short-range missiles that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. But Trump has consistently maintained that the tests do not violate a personal pledge Kim made during their first summit in Singapore last year to refrain from testing intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons.

Despite Trump’s unwillingness to criticize Kim, U.S. officials have been rebuffed time and again in their overtures to Kim’s underlings since the two leaders met at the Korean DMZ in late June, according to people briefed on the matter.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s hopes for a meeting with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho at the U.N. General Assembly were dashed when the North announced this week it would not participate in the international gathering, a shift from the past three years, when high-level delegations attended.

Two weeks ago, Ri insulted Pompeo, whom Pyongyang views as a hard-liner, by calling him “poisonous” to diplomacy."
Trump-walks-out.docx,"President Donald Trump has walked out of a meeting with Democratic leaders as negotiations broke down on the 19th day of a partial US government shutdown.

Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer stuck by their refusal to fund his US-Mexico border wall, prompting Mr Trump to call the meeting ""a total waste of time"".

Democrats again accused the president of throwing a ""temper tantrum"".

The first payday since the shutdown began is due on Friday for 800,000 federal workers, who will go unpaid.

Mr Trump has demanded $5.7bn to build a steel barrier, which would deliver on a key campaign pledge. But Democrats - who control the House of Representatives - have refused to back the funding.

How did the meeting go?

It was certainly brief, at only 14 minutes.

Mr Trump posed a direct question to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about whether she would fund the wall. His tweet following the meeting reflected the outcome of that - he said ""bye-bye"" and left.

Mr Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, confirmed the exchange, saying: ""He [Mr Trump] asked Speaker Pelosi, 'Will you agree to my wall?' She said No. 

""And he just got up and said, 'Then we have nothing to discuss,' and he just walked out. Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn't get his way.""

Mr Schumer reportedly asked Mr Trump: ""You are using people as leverage; why won't you open the government and stop hurting people?""

A White House official told the New York Times Mr Trump had said: ""I am trying to do the right thing for the country. This isn't about politics.""

Mr Schumer also said Mr Trump had ""slammed the table"" - prompting an angry response from the president denying it and insisting he had been polite.

Kevin McCarthy, Republican leader in the House of Representatives, said he found the Democrats' behaviour ""embarrassing"".

On Tuesday, Mr Trump delivered his first televised Oval Office address to the nation, where he described the border as a humanitarian and security crisis. The Democrats called the president's claims a fake threat.

How is the shutdown progressing?

This shutdown, which began on 22 December, has affected 25% of the government and some 800,000 federal employees. About 350,000 of them are furloughed, the rest are continuing to work without pay.

After past shutdowns, workers have generally been refunded with back pay, although that does not apply to those working for third-party contractors. The refunds are also not automatic - Congress must approve the measure.

Some affected federal workers who spoke to the BBC said they had resorted to a number of measures, including taking other jobs, racking up credit card bills, tapping into savings or taking on loans at high interest rates to pay their bills.

Thousands have also applied for unemployment benefits.

The Office of Personnel Management, which oversees federal workers, has urged them to reach out to creditors and landlords for a deferral or reduction of payments.

This weekend the shutdown will become the longest in US history."
GMV_Doc1_Impeachment-Dam-Breaking.docx,"Impeachment: Is the dam finally breaking?

Impeachment has dogged President Trump since the very earliest days of his presidency. Less than six months into his first term, in a move one of his former aides called the biggest self-inflicted wound of all time, he fired the director of the FBI in a botched attempt to call off the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Since then, the issue has come and gone depending on events. Many assumed that the Mueller Report would provide the evidence needed to convince Congress to move ahead with impeachment, but it did not. Ill-conceived campaigns for impeachment ended up politicizing the issue. And absent any sign that at least some Republican senators would vote to convict Trump, the House leadership has been reluctant to give the go-ahead.

But this week things changed. Speaker Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would begin impeachment proceedings.

A whistleblower revealed that in a conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky the president allegedly held up $391 million in aid appropriated for Ukraine’s military defense against Russia. This move was an effort to push for the Ukranian president’s promise to investigate alleged corruption by Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter. As Republican senators and government officials grew concerned about the delay, the Ukranian aid remained on hold. It was finally released two days before news of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky hit the press. The sheer audacity of using properly appropriated money and the formal powers of the presidency for personal political purposes shook Washington. 

Second, amidst all the usual demands for investigations, a group of Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to the Washington Post saying, “These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent.” “If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.” This letter, more than any other previous chapter in the Trump impeachment story, hit Washington because of who these members of Congress are. 

No one is an egocentric billionaire advocating impeachment as a way to run for the Democratic nomination for president. No one is a socialist. No one is from a far-left, safe Democratic district where the voters think cutting health care subsidies is grounds for impeachment. In fact, four of these districts lean Republican, two are slightly Democratic and one is dead-even between Democrats and Republicans according to the Partisan Voting Index. And everyone in this group has done something this president never has: served their country in a military or intelligence capacity.

What they have done is put their political futures on the line because they believe that President Trump has committed an offense that is truly impeachable. The House will pass articles of impeachment and the action will move to the Senate, where the search will be on for 20 more patriots. 

Within minutes of Speaker Pelosi’s remarks the Senate passed a measure urging release of the full whistleblower complaint. Under Senate rules all it took was one senator to block the resolution and none did."
Iran warns Trump over short war illusion as allies push him to keep the nuclear deal alive.docx,"President Trump arrived in Japan for a G-20 summit that will see him pressured by European allies to put the brakes on a dangerous standoff with Iran. Mr. Trump confounded the other parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last year when he pulled the U.S. unilaterally out of the agreement.

Tensions between Iran and the U.S. has risen since President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal and hit the Islamic Republic with harsh economic sanctions. One week ago, Mr. Trump stopped American warplanes from attacking Iranian targets for the shoot-down of a U.S. spy drone.

Iran had said that if European parties failed to put in place a mechanism by Thursday for them to work around the U.S. sanctions, it would exceed the nuclear deal's limit on its stockpiles of low-enriched uranium.

Will the nuke deal blow up?

Tehran has also set a deadline of July 7, when it stated it could breach a nuclear deal restriction on the level of purity of uranium it has enriched. That would dramatically shorten the time required to ""break out"" from a civilian nuclear program and build a nuclear weapon.

Pressure on the U.S.

Other parties to the nuclear agreement have called repeatedly for Iran not to abandon its agreements. Trump has long derided the agreement as too generous to Iran.

""I want to convince Trump that it is in his interest to re-open a negotiation process and go back on certain sanctions to give negotiations a chance,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said.

The U.S. leader will likely hear a similar message from the leaders of Germany and Britain. Military chiefs from those nations delivered the same message to Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. Esper told NATO allies the U.S. is not seeking a war, but reiterated the need to prevent Iran gaining a nuclear weapons capability and its support for militant groups across the Mideast.

Germany, France and other allies stressed that, in Europe's view, the agreement is the only viable way to keep Iran from developing that capacity without bloodshed, and said the deal should not be jeopardized.

The risk of war

Mr. Trump has drawn a red line under Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. If it comes to conflict, the Europeans, Russia and China, will be forced to take sides or to try and stand awkwardly on the sidelines.

Mr. Trump has warned that any war with Iran would see the ""obliteration"" of the country. He has also said a conflict with the Islamic Republic would be over quickly.

But a U.S. attack on Iran could draw a multi-pronged response: Iran has an extensive arsenal of conventional missiles and rockets, and it backs well-armed militant groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. It could choose to employ any or all of those resources to target not just U.S. personnel in the region, but also close allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Iran's Foreign Minister sent a tweet on Thursday, meanwhile, warning that ""misconceptions endanger peace."" He called any hope that a war with his country might be brief, ""an illusion."
GMV_Doc2_Trump-Impeachment-Democracy.docx,"Trump, Impeachment, and the Democracy That Happens Between Elections

There was always going to be a last straw, a single event that would launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, declared that Trump had finally gone too far, by “asking the President of Ukraine to take actions that would benefit him politically.” She was officially announcing the transition from investigation to an impeachment inquiry. “The President must be held accountable,” “No one is above the law.”

The six congressional committees that have been investigating Trump in a de-facto impeachment inquiry will continue their work, incorporating the newly urgent investigation of Trump’s July phone call with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, and the whistle-blower report. But what makes this event different from all the other malfeasances of the Trump Presidency? Trump has been credibly accused of breaking the law many times—nearly two hundred pages of the Mueller report document the President’s attempts to obstruct justice. Now he appears, judging from a newly released summary of the call, to have pressured a foreign leader to dig for dirt on a potential electoral opponent, tied the release of congressionally approved military aid to this request, and stopped the acting director of National Intelligence from releasing the resulting whistle-blower report to Congress. Why are these alleged crimes the ones that, in the estimation of Pelosi and the Democratic caucus, warrant impeachment proceedings? This is less a legal question than a political one.

The inquiry gains additional urgency because it concerns the 2020 Presidential election with Ukraine upstaging Russia. An election gave us Trump, and, impeachment proceedings notwithstanding, an election has the potential to rid us of him. For the past two and a half years, Trump has aspired to autocracy—attacking institutions, undermining and subverting the separation of powers—but, as long as his Presidency can be ended by an election, he has not consolidated autocratic power.

Democracy is what would happen between elections. Trump’s attacks on democracy include his war with the media, redefinition of American identity in white-male supremacist terms, isolationism, use of the Presidency for personal profit, campaign of packing the federal courts, verbal attacks on judges, and treatment of the judiciary as a nuisance on the way to getting things done—a view that he applies to the separation of powers. 

The event is an incident that resembles other in which Trump used his office for personal gain and sabotaged the system of checks and balances. His attempt to use two hundred and fifty million dollars of congressionally approved military aid for his own benefit falls in the same category as his and his children’s foreign business deals, brokered on the back of American diplomacy; his use of the Presidency to attract lobbyists, dignitaries, and perhaps entire summits as paying guests to his properties; and his use of taxpayer funds for incessant leisure travel. As the impeachment inquiry moves forward, it would behoove congressional Democrats, and all of us, to focus less on Ukraine and the election contamination by a foreign power and more on Trump’s pattern of abuse of executive power and the destruction it has wrought on American government."
Trump Approval Rating Down Slips With Base.docx,"While the longest government shutdown in U.S. history continues, President Trump's approval rating is down, and there are cracks showing with his base.

A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds Trump's approval rating down and his disapproval rating up from a month ago. He currently stands at 39 percent approve, 53 percent disapprove — a 7-point net change from December when his rating was 42 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove.

And the movement has come from within key portions of his base. He is:

Down significantly among suburban men, a net-positive approval rating of 51-to-39 percent to a net-negative of 42 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove. That's a net change of down 18 percentage points.

Down a net of 13 points among white evangelicals, from 73-to-17 percent approve to 66-to-23 percent approve.

Down a net of 10 points among Republicans, from 90-to-7 percent approve to 83-to-10 percent.

Down marginally among white men without a college degree, from 56-to-34 percent approve to 50-to-35 percent approve, a net change downward of 7 points.

""For the first time, we saw a fairly consistent pattern of having his base showing evidence of a cracking,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. ""Don't know if that's temporary — tied to the government shutdown — or a broader problem the president is having.""

The percentage of people now saying they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing is up to 45 percent, the highest for Trump since December 2017.

The president also faces some significant headwinds for re-election in 2020. Just 30 percent of registered voters said they will definitely vote for Trump in 2020, while 57 percent said they will definitely vote against him.

Just 76 percent of Trump supporters, 69 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of white evangelicals say they will definitely vote for him. Many, if not most, of them will likely vote for the president, but their softness in supporting him for re-election is a sign of vulnerability.

For context, in 2010, when asked about then-President Barack Obama, just 36 percent said they would definitely vote for him, while 48 percent said they would not. Obama went on to win with 51 percent of the vote.

But for Trump to have more than half the country already saying it definitely won't vote for him indicates he is facing a difficult re-election.

""The president has had his base and not much else,"" Miringoff said, ""and when you look ahead to the election ... he enters with a significant disadvantage. His re-election prospects would definitely be in jeopardy at this point.""

Trump has a lot of work to do to be able to reassemble the coalition that voted for him narrowly to win in the Electoral College in 2016. He lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and won just 46 percent of the vote. He won by about 70,000 votes combined between Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, all states that have trended away from the president during his first two years in office."
Elusive Wall-for-DACA Deal Could Be Key to Ending Government Shutdown.docx,"There’s a lot of political posturing we will still have to go through before an end to the partial government shutdown can occur. Most fundamentally, President Trump must be sure he has put out the fire on his right flank that roared into view when it looked like he was going to back off on a border-wall-funding demand in exchange for signing an appropriations bill. That means something that he can construe as a concession on the wall must be wrung from Democratic congressional leaders who are publicly adamant about denying him exactly that. Democrats certainly won’t make any moves away from that position until the House has passed Nancy Pelosi’s bill, which extends Homeland Security funding into next month without wall funding and releases the rest of the federal government from the whole dispute.

A DACA-for-Wall deal has been on (or near) the table during immigration talks for well over a year. It probably came closest to fruition in February of 2018, when a bipartisan group of senators devised a proposal — but the White House shot it down, as CNN reported at the time:

A much-anticipated bipartisan deal that would have paired a pathway to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children with $25 billion in border security and some other measures failed to get the 60 votes necessary to advance legislation after furious White House opposition …



The episode, coming at the end of a much-anticipated Senate week of debate on immigration, revealed that the White House was able to kill momentum for a deal that had emerged out of weeks of talks by roughly 20 bipartisan senators – but that it also had no ability to enact any legislation to achieve its stated goal of protecting the recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Donald Trump is ending, and increasing border security measures along with it.



One problem is that a straightforward DACA-for-Wall deal has been considerably complicated by Trump adviser Stephen Miller’s obsession with securing restrictions on legal immigration as a condition for any Dreamer relief. Indeed, the February 2018 bipartisan proposal had some provisions reflecting administration demands for reductions in “lottery” visas and family-based immigration sponsorships. But the White House kept moving the goalposts, and now it seems hell-bent on restrictions on refugees as well as on other immigrants who seek legally provided entry.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina urged the White House and Democrats to consider supporting what he called a “breakthrough” compromise on immigration that would allow President Trump to secure his $5 billion demand for border security funds and also codify protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders. 



It’s clear, however, that congressional Democrats aren’t going to start making positive noises about such a deal until such time as Trump embraces it, given his long history of flip-flopping on DACA in particular. And they may also decide that Graham’s temporary DACA extension is no substitute for the path to citizenship for Dreamers that Trump — in principle, at least — has intermittently supported."
The US government shutdown is now the longest such closure in history.docx,"The US government shutdown is now the longest such closure in history. On Sunday, day 23, members of Congress were out of Washington, Donald Trump was unmoved in the White House, his border wall unbuilt, and around 800,000 federal workers were still without pay and facing mounting hardship.



From a White House he described as empty, Trump complained on Twitter about multiple reports in the press that his administration is in chaos, lacking a plan to end the impasse.



“I do have a plan on the Shutdown,” Trump wrote. “But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!”



Trump added: “We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their ‘vacations’ and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!”



Trump has however repeatedly pledged to veto legislation initially supported by both parties to reopen the government, without funding for his wall.



Friday was the first payday of the year for federal workers and contractors affected by the closure, some at home, some forced to work. Some paychecks turned up blank. Contractors may not recoup lost earnings. As callouts rose among workers deemed essential, so did problems for government programmes, for courts, national parks and vital transport and infrastructure services including major airports.



Even White House staffing is severely affected, prompting Trump to complain in a tweet: “There’s almost nobody in the WH but me.”



On Saturday the shutdown passed the 21-day mark set when Bill Clinton faced a Republican Congress in 1995 and 1996. Nine of 15 cabinet-level departments were not funded. Earlier, Trump backed away from threats to declare a national emergency and build the wall with money appropriated from military, water management and disaster management funds, among other sources.

“We want Congress to do its job,” the president said in a discussion on border security at the White House. “What we’re not looking to do right now is national emergency.”



Nonetheless, Trump insisted he had the right to declare an emergency if he chose to, and continued to insist there was a crisis at the border.



“Other presidents have called national emergencies for lesser importance than this,” he told Fox News in an interview on Saturday night.



Democrats reject Trump’s insistence there is a crisis and continue to prepare a response to an emergency declaration that would involve recourse to the courts.



The impasse is over the $5.7bn needed for a wall on the border with Mexico that Trump promised on the campaign trail, saying Mexico would pay for it. Democrats who control the House are determined not to give it to him, whether or not – and most analysts say not – he is correct that savings from a new trade deal will mean Mexico pays after all.



The White House has suggested building the wall with steel rather than concrete as a key concession."
CMC_Doc1_trade_war_economics.docx,"Donald Trump’s opponent in his trade war is actually economics, and he will certainly lose

With each passing day, it becomes increasingly evident that US President Donald Trump’s administration cares less about economics and more about the aggressive exercise of political power. This is obviously a source of enormous frustration for those of us who practise the art and science of economics.

Trade policy is an obvious and essential case in point. Showing no appreciation of the time-honoured linkage between trade deficits and macroeconomic saving-investment imbalances, the president continues to fixate on  bilateral solutions to a multilateral problem– in effect, blaming China for America’s merchandise trade deficits with 102 countries. 

The same can be said of fiscal policy. Trump’s deficit-busting tax cuts and increases in government spending make no sense for an economy nearing a business-cycle peak and with an unemployment rate of 3.8 per cent. Moreover, the feedback loop through the savings channel only exacerbates the very trade problems that Trump claims to be solving.

With the Congressional Budget Office projecting that federal budget deficits will average 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product from now until 2023, domestic saving will come under further pressure, fuelling increased demand for surplus saving from abroad and even bigger trade deficits to fill the void. Yet Trump now ups the ante on tariffs – in effect, biting the very hand that feeds the US economy. 

So what Trump is doing is not about economics – or at least not about economics as most academics, political leaders and citizens know it. 

This should not be all that surprising. Trump’s battle with China merely underscores his eagerness – transparent from the start – to use economics as a foil in his pitch to “make America great again”. Contrary to his bluster over unfair trade deficits, China’s real challenge to the US is less about economics and more about the race for technological and military supremacy.

Indeed, the pendulum of geopolitical leadership is now in motion. China’s massive pan-Asian infrastructure plan, the Belt and Road Initiative, together with its muscular behaviour in the South China Sea, pose far greater threats to American hegemony than does one bilateral piece of a much larger multilateral trade deficit.

Moreover, in 1988, the US had a net domestic saving rate of 5.6 per cent of national income – only slightly below the 6.3 per cent average of the final three decades of the 20th century, but nearly four times the current rate. Back then, the US was spending US$270 billion on defence – less than half the US$700 billion authorised in the current budget, which now outstrips the combined military outlays of China, Russia, the United Kingdom, India, France, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Germany.

Meanwhile, China has ascended. Back in 1988, its per capita GDP was just 4 per cent of the US level (in purchasing-power-parity terms). This year, that ratio is close to 30 per cent – nearly an eightfold increase in just three decades.

Like Trump, Xi does not do capitulation. Unlike Trump, Xi understands the linkage between economic and geostrategic power. Trump claims that trade wars are easy to win. Not only is he at risk of underestimating his adversary, but he may be even more at risk of overestimating America’s strength. The trade war may well be an early skirmish in a much tougher battle, during which economics will ultimately trump Trump."
Trump Administration Calls for Medicaid Overhaul Home Health Care News.docx,"The Trump administration on Monday released its proposed budget for fiscal year 2020, calling for government-wide domestic spending cuts of 5%, a site-neutral payment system for health care providers and a major Medicaid overhaul.

The proposed budget ó unlikely to make it past a democrat-controlled House of Representatives ó also seeks to curb Medicare spending by increasing prior authorization on items vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse.

While presidential budget proposals seldom proceed as submitted, they offer insight into priorities for the year ahead. Any Trump administration efforts to minimize the Medicaid or Medicare programs, however, would assuredly be met with resistance from home-based care advocates and providers, many of whom are feeling financial pressures from a worsening labor crisis and lagging reimbursement levels.

Indeed, the White House budget proposal raises important concerns for home care and hospice providers, National Association for Home Care & Hospice (NAHC) President William A. Dombi said in a statement shared with Home Health Care News, specifically mentioning the block granting of Medicaid and instituting rate cuts for Medicare post-acute services.

ìIt is crucial that support for home care and hospice be increased as the value of these services grows with innovation, efficiencies and quality improvement,î Dombi said. ìWe look forward to working with the administration and the Congress as we tackle the challenges of health care delivery together.î

Under the Trump administrationís proposed budget, defense-related spending would increase to $750 billion in 2020, a more than 4.7% bump from 2019 levels. Meanwhile, spending on non-defense programs would drop to $567 billion, a decrease of more than 5%.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spending would plummet by about 31% under the proposed budget, while departments of State and Transportation spending would decrease by 23% and 22%, respectively. 

On a long-term basis, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would be hit by the proposed spending cuts in several key ways.

President Donald Trumpís ìBudget for a Better Americaî would slash roughly $846 billion from Medicare framework over the next 10 years, an HHCN review found. The proposed budget includes several legislative proposals and administrative actions to reduce monetary loss from improper payments, including an increase in Medicare Advantage (MA) payment audits.

But perhaps the biggest Medicare-related change featured in the budget proposal is site-neutral payment reform tying payment to patient characteristics rather than care setting. The creation of a unified post-acute care payment system alone would save about $101.2 billion from 2020 through 2029, according to the Trump administration.

ìBy ensuring payments are accurately aligned with the costs of care and strengthening providers accountability to improve quality and health outcomes, the budget protects seniors from excessive out-of-pocket costs and improves the standard of care they receive,î the administration wrote in its budget proposal.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has repeatedly recommended a shift to a post-acute payment system over the past few years. Currently, Medicare uses separate payment systems across the post-acute care environment, comprised of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), home health agencies, IRFs and long-term care hospitals (LTCHs)."
Wall-Relief-Funds.docx,"President Trump traveled to the border on Thursday to warn of crime and chaos on the frontier, as White House officials considered diverting emergency aid from storm- and fire-ravaged Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California to build a border barrier, perhaps under an emergency declaration.

In a sign of growing unease about the partial government shutdown, some Senate Republicans came off the sidelines to hash out a deal that would reopen the government as Congress worked toward a broader agreement tying wall funds to protection for some undocumented immigrants and other migrants.

But before those negotiations could gain momentum, they collapsed. Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Mr. Trump’s team let it be known privately that the president would not back such a deal.

“It kind of fell apart,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who was among those Republicans seeking a deal.

“It is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier,” he said later in a brief statement. He added, “I hope it works.”

The administration appeared to be looking into just such a solution: using extraordinary emergency powers to get around Congress in funding the wall. 

Administration officials are debating whether they could make such a move without the president declaring a national emergency.

But Mr. Trump’s advisers have urged him to try to find other approaches than declaring a national emergency. 

The advisers have warned him of a range of possible negative outcomes, particularly the risk of losing in court, people familiar with the discussions said.

Aides have suggested that Mr. Trump would be giving a dysfunctional Congress a pass from fulfilling its duties if he makes an aggressive move. And some of his more conservative advisers have suggested a national emergency declaration is a form of government overreach that is antithetical to conservative principles.

Mr. Trump also repeated his demand for the money from Congress while saying that Mexico would somehow provide funds indirectly for the wall, a contradiction of what he said in December.

“I didn’t say they’re going to write me a check for $10 billion or $20 billion,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “If Congress approves this trade bill, they’ll pay for the wall many times over. When I say Mexico’s going to pay for the wall, that’s what I mean.”

It was among the bewildering statements that underscored his often contradictory attempts to force Democrats to capitulate. Mr. Trump renewed his threat to declare a national emergency and build his wall without congressional approval.

“We can declare a national emergency,” Mr. Trump said. “We shouldn’t have to.”

Later, standing just by the Rio Grande with military vehicles and border agents as his backdrop, he said he would consider a compromise that would allow undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, often known as Dreamers, to maintain legal status they lost when he ended the Obama-era program that protected them."
Comey_Fired.docx,"President Trump on Tuesday fired the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, abruptly terminating the top official leading a criminal investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s advisers colluded with the Russian government to steer the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The stunning development in Mr. Trump’s presidency raised the specter of political interference by a sitting president into an existing investigation by the nation’s leading law enforcement agency. It immediately ignited Democratic calls for a special counsel to lead the Russia inquiry. Mr. Trump explained the firing by citing Mr. Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, even though the president was widely seen to have benefited politically from that inquiry and had once praised Mr. Comey for his “guts” in his pursuit of Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. But in his letter to Mr. Comey, released to reporters by the White House, the president betrayed his focus on the continuing inquiry into Russia and his aides. “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,” Mr. Trump said in a letter to Mr. Comey dated Tuesday. White House officials refused to say anything more about the three occasions Mr. Trump cited. The officials said that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, pushed for Mr. Comey’s dismissal. But many in Washington, including veteran F.B.I. officers, saw a carefully choreographed effort by the president to create a pretense for a takedown of the president’s F.B.I. tormentor. “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails,” Mr. Rosenstein wrote in another letter that was released by the White House, “and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken.” Reaction in Washington was swift and fierce. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said the firing could make Americans suspect a cover-up. Mr. Trump lashed back later Tuesday night in a Twitter post: “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer stated recently, ʻI do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.’ Then acts so indignant.” Many Republicans assailed the president for making a rash decision that could have deep implications for their party. Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said on Twitter that he now supports an independent commission to investigate the Russia links to Mr. Trump. He called Mr. Trump’s claim that Mr. Comey had cleared him three times “bizarre.” “I’ve spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey’s firing,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said on Twitter. “I just can’t do it.” In a sign of the F.B.I.’s intense interest in Mr. Trump’s advisers, a grand jury in Virginia issued subpoenas in recent weeks for records related to the former White House national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, according to an American official familiar with the case. Mr. Flynn is under investigation for his financial ties to Russia and Turkey."
EH_Doc2_Trump-trade-war-Farmers-Factory.docx,"Trump’s Trade War Hammering Farmers, Factory Workers In Crucial Wisconsin

The state could be key to his reelection, but the tariff wars are devastating key voting blocs.



S.V. Date/HuffPost Will Hughes looks over 400 acres of organic soybeans at his family’s farm in Janesville, Wisconsin. The farm has lost about $500,000 in income because of President Donald Trump’s trade war with China. 

EAST TROY, Wis. – Farm Aid musicians who over three-and-a-half decades have helped farmers cope with torrential floods, withering droughts and epidemics of bank foreclosures this year added a new calamity to their list: President Donald Trump’s trade war.

“With devastating weather, low prices and harmful farm and trade policies, America’s family farmers are facing immense challenges to hold onto their farms,” Farm Aid founder Willie Nelson said prior to his appearance here Saturday at the 2019 benefit concert. “It’s not right.”

Wisconsin has become ground zero for Trump’s tariff battles with an assortment of foreign foes ― battles that come following years of depressed milk prices that have driven dairy farmers out of business and a spring of drenching floods.

“It’s really salt on the wound,” said Alicia Harvie, Farm Aid’s advocacy and farm services director. “It’s happening at the worst possible time for farmers.”

In Wisconsin, though, they are not the trade war’s only victims. From Harley-Davidson factory workers worrying about their jobs as their company’s profits tanks, to a weather equipment maker forced to pay hefty import taxes, to a kidney beans processor facing retaliatory tariffs in Europe, a wide swath of voters are losing money and, in some cases, their livelihoods in a state that could determine Trump’s fate next November.

“I can’t imagine it isn’t going to hurt him,” said Randy Jasper, who with his son grows soybeans, one of the crops hardest hit when China closed its market to many U.S. agricultural products last year to retaliate against Trump’s import duties on Chinese goods.

Jasper added that Trump will not get away with downplaying the economic damage or claiming that his $28 billion-and-counting in bailouts have made everything better. Farmers and their families and friends understand full well what’s happening, he said. “Everybody knows. It’s out there in the real world.”

Tim Corkum, who owns an art gallery in the downtown strip of Menomonee Falls just blocks from the Harley-Davidson factory, said that even in his deeply Republican town ― “You can’t make this place any redder if you opened up an aorta and sprayed it all over” ― he’s hearing from people tired of Trump.

“It’s becoming clearer to them that putting a failed real estate tycoon in charge of the international economy wasn’t such a great idea,” he said.

Trump clearly continues to have his strong devotees, particularly among those who have not been personally affected by the tariffs. These supporters say they cannot think of any circumstance that would force them to reconsider their votes.

For Trump, losing even a small fraction of the votes he won in 2016 could mean losing Wisconsin ― and a second term.

A key state in 2016, and again in 2020

Trump and his political advisers have been acutely aware of Wisconsin’s role in putting him in the Oval Office. It, along with Pennsylvania and Michigan, had not voted Republican in decades. Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign had assumed Wisconsin voters would support her and did not bother bringing her there ― a point that both Trump and his aides frequently make.

Yet Trump’s combined victory margin in those three states was just 77,744 votes. In Wisconsin, it was 22,748 votes, or 0.8 percent, and post-election analyses showed it largely resulted from a dramatic drop-off of support for Clinton compared to former President Barack Obama’s showing in 2012. Trump actually won fewer votes in Wisconsin than Obama’s opponent in the election, Republican Mitt Romney."
Trump Proposes Big Cuts to Health Programs Washington Post.docx,"The Trump administration is proposing a sharp slowdown in Medicaid spending as part of a broad reduction in the governmentís investment in health care, calling for the public insurance for the poor to morph from an entitlement program to state block grants even after a Republican Congress rejected the idea.

The budget released by the White House on Monday also calls for a sizable reduction for Medicare, the federal insurance for older Americans that President Trump has consistently promised to protect. Most of the trims relate to changing payments to doctors and hospitals and renewing efforts to ferret out fraud and wasteful billing ó oft-cited targets by presidents of both parties.

In keeping with Trumpís promise in last monthís State of the Union address to halt the spread of HIV over the next decade, the budget includes an initial installment of $291?million next year targeted to communities where the virus is continuing to infect people not getting proper treatment ó the rural parts of seven states, including Mississippi; the District of Columbia; Puerto Rico and 48 hot-spot counties scattered throughout the country.

However, the spending plan would cut funding for global AIDS programs while slashing expenditures on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by about 10?percent.

Strategies the president and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar advocate to curb the rising price of prescription drugs are part of the budget. But spending on the National Institutes of Health, a longtime favorite of lawmakers of both parties, would be reduced by $4.5?billion, with the National Cancer Institute proposed to absorb the largest chunk of that cut. Funding for pediatric cancer research, however, would increase by $50?million for the next fiscal year.

Taken together, the $87.1?billion in discretionary funding for HHS programs would be 12?percent less than in the spending plan Congress adopted for this fiscal year ó although the proposal is unlikely to survive lawmakersí scrutiny.

The idea of opening Medicaid to block grants to states ó or a related idea that would create per-person funding caps ó are fundamental alterations of an entitlement program run jointly by the federal government and states that began in the 1960s as part of the War on Poverty and have always provided each state a share of funding for anyone who is eligible. The budget calls for limiting the programís growth to the pace of inflation.

Because health-care spending typically rises more swiftly than the consumer price index, tying it to the nationís overall inflation rate would put a strong squeeze on the public insurance system that covers tens of thousands of poor, vulnerable people, some of them elderly.

The spending plan calls for a cut of nearly $1.5?trillion in Medicaid over 10 years and for $1.2?trillion to be added for the block grants or per-person caps that would start in 2021. Under the new arrangement, states would gain far more freedom to set their own rules about how to cover the poor.

The budget also would eliminate funding for Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which has gone to about three dozen states over the past five years."
"US- China trade agreement still ‘very much in the air’ despite Trump, Xi meeting, Chinese state media says.docx","President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday agreed to resume trade talks and a cease-fire on escalating tensions — but Chinese state media said later that a trade agreement between the two countries is still “very much in the air.”

Trump and Xi met Saturday in Osaka, Japan, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in an effort to push forward trade talks after tensions escalated last month when the U.S. raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent. Trump said Saturday he won’t move ahead with his plan to impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods for the “time being.”

""We're going to work with China where we left off,"" Trump said Saturday. He also said China had agreed to buy more American farm products.

 

China Daily, an English-language daily China often uses to relay messages, said in an opinion piece that although a U.S.-China trade deal is now more likely to happen, there’s still a long road ahead before both sides come to a 100 percent agreement.

 

“Even though Washington agreed to postpone levying additional tariffs on Chinese goods to make way for negotiations, and Trump even hinted at putting off decisions on Huawei until the end of negotiations, things are still very much up in the air,” the Chinese Daily editorial published late Saturday stated.

“Agreement on 90 percent of the issues has proved not to be enough, and with the remaining 10 percent where their fundamental differences reside, it is not going to be easy to reach a 100-percent consensus, since at this point, they remain widely apart even on the conceptual level,” it continued.

Trump had tweeted Saturday that his meeting with Xi went “far better than expected” and said along with halting additional tariffs, he was also allowing U.S. companies to sell some components to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The company was placed on a blacklist last month because it was a threat to national security.

 

“I had a great meeting with President Xi of China yesterday, far better than expected. I agreed not to increase the already existing Tariffs that we charge China while we continue to negotiate,” Trump wrote in a series of tweets. “China has agreed that, during the negotiation, they will begin purchasing large amounts of agricultural product from our great Farmers. At the request of our High Tech companies, and President Xi, I agreed to allow Chinese company Huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our National Security.”

Trump added that trade negotiations have resumed and the U.S.’s relationship with China remains a “very good one.”

 

“The quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed. I am in no hurry, but things look very good! There will be no reduction in the Tariffs currently being charged to China,” he concluded.

 

Trump said that Huawei will stay on the blacklist, however, and that its future won't be decided until the end of the trade talks."
trump-administration-plan-for-ai.docx,"THE US LEADS the world in artificial intelligence technology. Decades of federal research funding, industrial and academic research, and streams of foreign talent have put America at the forefront of the current AI boom.

Yet as AI aspirations have sprouted around the globe, the US government has lacked a high-level strategy to guide American investment and prepare for the technology’s effects.

President Trump signed an executive order creating a program called the American AI Initiative. It doesn’t include new funding or specific AI projects. But it orders the federal government to direct existing funds, programs, and data in support of AI research and commercialization.

The new initiative also asks agencies to help US workers adjust to jobs that have been or will be changed by AI, and to consider how the technology may require new regulations.

“AI has really become a transformative technology that’s changing industries, markets, and society,” says Lynne Parker, who leads work on AI in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. 

Parker previously contributed to work by the Obama administration that, a month prior to Trump’s election, led to reports on AI’s potential and societal implications, and a plan for future research. 

Artificial intelligence is the 60-year-old quest to make machines capable of mental or physical tasks seen as emblematic of human or animal intelligence. In the past seven years a technology called machine learning, in which algorithms gain skills by digesting example data, has allowed computers to become markedly better at understanding the world. That technology has birthed software able to read medical scans, spawned virtual assistants that answer shouted trivia questions, and become the heart of every major tech company’s product strategy.

One element of the Trump administration plan would open some stocks of government data to academics and companies doing AI research. 

The White House says it will ask agencies in areas such as health and transportation to release data that could advance AI research, using mechanisms that protect privacy. 

The plan Trump signed also directs federal agencies to prioritize AI when allocating their R&D budgets. It asks them to support training and fellowship programs that will help workers adjust to jobs changed by AI, and to train future AI experts and researchers.

White House staff will work with regulators like the Department of Transportation and the Food and Drug Administration to consider how AI technologies such as driverless cars and software that diagnoses disease may require new or revised regulations.

Researchers, civil liberties groups, and some companies have called for new ethical norms and regulation on AI. 

The executive order on AI does not concern itself with immigration. That’s despite the importance of foreign talent to AI projects and progress in the US, and worries among American AI researchers that Trump administration immigration policy is harming the field.

Some AI programs might benefit from a change to the H-1B skilled visa program announced in January. It will now slightly favor holders of advanced degrees from US institutions, seen as beneficial to tech companies working on advanced technologies.

Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington, says it’s good to see the White House taking AI and its effects seriously. He also says it will take time to know whether the Trump administration is properly attending to the ethical and human rights questions raised by AI."
Trump-Along-Border.docx,"McALLEN, Tex. — President Trump arrived in this border town Thursday on a trip that he did not want to take to discuss a crisis that Democrats say does not exist, repeating his request for a long-promised border wall that has led to a bitter political impasse and a 20-day government shutdown.

Flanked by Border Patrol officers, as well as Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, and a cache of drugs, cash and weapons seized by the authorities at the border, Mr. Trump again blamed the protracted shutdown affecting vast swaths of the federal government on Democrats. He reiterated an untrue claim that Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revamped trade agreement, and heard from people who had loved ones killed by immigrants.

“If we had a barrier of any kind, whether it’s steel or concrete,” Mr. Trump said of tragic stories involving violence and human trafficking, “they wouldn’t even bother trying. We could stop that cold.”

But as the government shutdown neared the end of its third week, the president left Washington with no additional negotiations scheduled with congressional leaders over a possible compromise that could both provide border security and open the government. In remarks to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Trump did not rule out declaring a state of national emergency that could allow him to bypass Congress to fund the wall.

Asked if he would make such a declaration, an action that would likely face legal challenges, Mr. Trump said: “If this doesn’t work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.”

In the meeting with Border Patrol officials, Mr. Trump did not emphasize the need for an emergency, but invited locals to help him make his case. 

A local pastor declared the problem a “humanitarian crisis.” Border Patrol officers used visual aids showing stash houses, road checkpoints and drug caches to emphasize the demand for border security and a wall. And at one point, Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who waged a brutal political battle with the president as an opponent during the 2016 primaries, praised Mr. Trump for “infusing more backbone” in the capital.

“When we see politicians go on TV and say the border’s secure and there is no crisis,” Mr. Cruz said, “they are ignoring reality.”

Mr. Trump repeated his demand for the money from Congress while telling the group that Mexico would somehow provide funds indirectly for the wall, a contradiction of what he said in December when he wrote in a Twitter post, “I often stated, ‘One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.’”

 “I didn’t say they’re going to write me a check for $10 billion or $20 billion,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “If Congress approves this trade bill, they’ll pay for the wall many times over. When I say Mexico’s going to pay for the wall, that’s what I mean.”

The new trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, does not stipulate that Mexico provide funds for the wall, and has not been approved by Congress."
NATO_US-European Relations.docx,"Nato at 70: Europe fears tensions will outlast Trump As the military alliance celebrates its anniversary, America’s commitment is being questioned

Michael Peel in Brussels and Aime Williams in Washington April 2, 2019 

When Nato celebrated its 50th anniversary at a 1999 summit in Washington, President Bill Clinton sought to assure America’s allies that the end of the cold war would not reduce its commitment to the region. Citing Theodore Roosevelt, he said there was no doubt that the US would continue to play a “great part in the world . . . The only question is whether we will play it well or ill”.

At the time, European leaders could afford to smile at the reference. But as Nato prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary in Washington this week, the ambivalence of Mr Clinton’s remark seems charged. 

The big question for the European countries that dominate Nato numerically — if not militarily — is whether what one analyst dubs the “transatlantic distancing” will reverse after Mr Trump leaves office, or widen further. The president has flayed allies over military spending and pan-EU defence projects. He has also pulled the US out of an atomic weapons control treaty with Russia and a nuclear accord with Iran, actions many Europeans see as having a potential direct impact on security. Some in Europe already view Mr Trump’s approach to the relationship as part of a lasting change in the way Washington views the world. European leaders see a great power competition amid the growing US preoccupation with China and a belief that the US military should deploy more sparingly and Europe should take on more responsibility, albeit on Washington’s terms.

For some Europeans, the present difficulties mark a belated awakening to strategic realities that have been evident since the end of the cold war. Many of the criticisms of the transatlantic relationship articulated by Mr Trump are not new. US presidents from both parties have long called for Europe to spend more on their militaries — and many Europeans acknowledge the need to do so, given that only six countries other than the US hit the 2 per cent of GDP target last year.

European military spending had already started to rise, in part because of US pressure and also due to the shock of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. The US has long been suspicious of EU plans to encourage greater military co-operation. Although the US has called on Europe to spend more on defence, it resents the idea that countries might develop their armed forces outside Nato and become too independent. Months before the alliance’s 50th anniversary in 1999, Madeleine Albright, drew her so called “three Ds” -- “no diminution of Nato, no discrimination and no duplication”.

Where Mr Trump has gone much further than his predecessors is in his doubts that European security is a prize worth paying for. Rather than the sort of rupture that Mr Trump occasionally flirts with, analysts say the bigger risk to the alliance is a slow decay in the face of uncertainty about Washington’s true commitment. 

The current tension is “permanent because it’s structural”, says Claudia Major, a defence analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “Trump is particularly brutal — but many of the ideas we in Europe find problematic have long been there.”

How Immigration Became So Controversial.docx,"How Immigration became real problem –

Immigration seems to be the most prominent wedge issue in America. Senate Republicans and Democrats shut down the federal government over the treatment of immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, also known as Dreamers. 

The immigration issue was never easy. But it hasn’t always been this confusing.

The most common economic arguments against immigrants, particularly those that are low-skilled workers, are two-fold. First, there is the concern that new arrivals pull down wages for the low-income Americans with whom they compete. The evidence here is mixed and controversial, but a 2008 meta-analysis of more than 100 papers studying the effect of immigration on native-born wage growth characterized the impact on wages as “very small” and “more than half of the time statistically insignificant.” Second, there is a concern that immigrants are a drain on federal resources. It’s true that the first generation of low-skilled adults can receive more in health care, income support, and retirement benefits than they pay in taxes. But as their children grow up, find jobs, and pay taxes themselves, most immigrant families wind up being net contributors to the government over their decades-long residence in the U.S., according to a 2016 report from the National Academy of Sciences.

Too often lost in this discussion of wage and budget effect is the question of whether a rich country has a moral obligation to help poor families—particularly those in political distress—by admitting them as legal immigrants. The single most unambiguous, most uncontroversial fact about immigration is that it raises the living standards of poorer foreign-born workers. It is, essentially, the world’s most effective foreign-aid program on a per capita basis. But, more than mere charity, high levels of immigration seem to materially benefit the United States. America’s immigrant population is in many ways a model of the future of the country—more entrepreneurial, more likely to move toward opportunity, and all together more dynamic. To regard this community as something the United States should banish from the body politic is to mistake a vital organ for a cancer.

I have written that the current demographic and political makeup of the U.S. electorate (and other countries) makes it vulnerable to a race-baiting populist like Donald Trump, who can marshal the latent tribalism of a fading white majority to harass immigrants. But the United States’ demographic picture is changing quickly. The generation of Americans under 30 are the most diverse cohort in the U.S., the most fervently against the construction of any wall, and the most accepting of immigrants, even those that don’t speak fluent English.

The majority of children born in 2015 were non-white. That means even if the GOP hardliners managed to permanently end immigration this weekend, the United States’ white majority would decline into one of many non-majority pluralities within a few decades, anyway. No matter whether the future of the Republican Party is Stephen Miller or the Koch Brothers, multiracial nationalism is the future of the United States. No other nation is on the way. There is no other future to unite around."
AMZ_Doc1_Trump_trade_war_sink_promise_revive_manufacturing.docx,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/09/04/the-finance-202-trump-s-trade-war-is-sinking-his-promise-to-revive-american-manufacturing/5d6ed3f5602ff171a5d733cf/ 



President Trump has promised to spark a revival for American manufacturing. But there's new evidence that his trade war is doing exactly the opposite.

In another sign the president's crusade against China is hurting the U.S. economy, factory activity shrank in August for the first time in three years, according to a new survey.  

The measures the Institute for Supply Management uses for domestic manufacturing’s health fell nearly across the board. New orders for manufactured goods dropped for the second month in a row to a level not seen since late 2009; production and employment contracted for the first time in three years. Another report on manufacturing activity — from IHS Markit, also released Tuesday — confirmed the findings, showing the weakest manufacturing activity in nearly a decade. 

Stocks slumped on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding 425 points by midmorning before staging a late rally and closing down 285 points, or 1 percent. But taken with new signs of trouble in the global economy, the flashing red signal of an inverted yield curve at home, and no end in sight to the U.S.-China trade confrontation, investors are clearly nervous a recession could be on the horizon. 

The slowdown in American manufacturing comes as the sector has hit a skid worldwide, a development dating to last year that has grown worse as trade tensions have intensified. But the ISM survey left little doubt that the president’s tariff fight is weighing on manufacturers. Four of 10 respondents that the survey quoted invoked the trade war as a top concern (“While business is strong, there is an undercurrent of fear and alarm regarding the trade wars and a potential recession,” one respondent working in chemical products said.) None mentioned Trump’s preferred explanation for weakness in the sector: That the Federal Reserve hasn’t been aggressive enough in slashing interest rates. 

And some economists and market watchers are warning that with no sign of the president deescalating his trade fight, the worst is yet to come. 

“Unfortunately we're struggling to think of reasons why the required policy U-turn on the part of Mr. Trump might be imminent. It's coming, we think, once he begins properly to appreciate that Chinese are not going to fold and that the tariffs are a serious threat to his chance of re-election. But not yet,” Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson wrote in a Tuesday note. “The headline ISM index is not yet bad enough to signal a recession in the broad economy — that requires a further drop of five points or so — or outright declines in payrolls. But it is weak, and still weakening, with no end in sight to the downshift. If the President and his economic advisers aren't now nervous about the outlook, they should be.”

For companies feeling a sharper pinch from the trade war, Morgan Stanley notes that the waning effects of the tax cuts are making the pain from tariffs feel more intense. A strengthened dollar is also putting a crimp on the sector."
Trumps-Oval-Office.docx,"Trump's Oval Office address shows he's hit a wall on the border wall

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has hit a wall.

That is, his border wall isn't selling — and he appears to know it.

He didn't get Mexico to pay for it. Congress won't cough up the cash, either. The partial government shutdown he said he'd be ""proud"" to own in the name of forcing Democrats to capitulate on the barrier is well into its third week. And with a handful of Republicans starting to break ranks publicly, Democratic leaders have shown no signs of backing down.

Except for a cosmetic change — Trump said he'll accept a steel barrier instead of a concrete wall — the president hasn't tinkered with the product he's marketing. But on Tuesday, in his first address from the Oval Office, he wrapped it in a rhetorical shroud that he's been using recently in lower-profile settings: now, in his estimation, the wall is needed because of the ""humanitarian"" crisis at the border.

""Women and children are the biggest victims by far of our broken system,"" Trump said. ""This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.""

But for years — and even at moments in his Tuesday night address — Trump has portrayed immigrants as a scourge on American society. Usually, he makes the distinction that he is talking about undocumented immigrants, and some — who he's dubbed murderers, rapists and animals — but not all of them.

That argument was the centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign, his barnstorming tour of the nation on behalf of Republican candidates before last November's midterm elections and his remarks from the Oval Office Tuesday night.

""Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now,"" he said. ""This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.""

His remarks seemed highly unlikely to move Congress in his direction. He has asked for a $7 billion appropriation, including $5.7 billion for the promised border wall. But the Republican-led Congress denied him the money he sought in the last Congress, and Democrats, who now control the House and retain the numbers to sustain a filibuster in the Senate, haven't so much as blinked.

""I don't think he advanced his case one bit,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said on MSNBC's ""The Last Word"" following the Oval Office address.

Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor, said Trump may have done little to persuade his critics.

""The president’s speech will make his base happy — shows he’s working on keeping his promises,"" Eberhart said. ""It’s unlikely to convince Democrats or independents. The Democrats have an opportunity here to rise above partisan politics and make a counteroffer to the president and get the government open. Instead — so far — they have been more interested in denying Trump a win."""
Presidential-Obstruction-Justice.docx,"In this paper we conclude that, based upon public reports, there is substantial evidence that President Trump may have obstructed justice. While a final determination must wait until Special Counsel Mueller has completed his investigation, that body of reported evidence has only grown deeper in quantity and quality in recent months. The apparent depth of the evidence is further underscored by reporting that White House Counsel Don McGahn was extensively cooperating with the special counsel, which could provide otherwise unavailable details of the president's exact state of mind and actions during critical moments.The obstruction case against President Trump includes the entire pattern of conduct detailed in Section I. Although President Trump’s firing of Director Comey is incriminating in its own right, the strength of the case against the president lies in the pattern of obstructive conduct in which he has potentially engaged. Far from engaging in acts that may constitute only a technical violation of the statutes that in ordinary circumstances might not be prosecuted, President Trump appears to have been engaged in an ongoing campaign of obstructive conduct since taking office.



We begin our analysis of those facts in Section II under the law of obstruction of justice, which is, in essence, interference with the rule of law. Congress has created a number of offenses to capture the broad range of conduct that constitutes such interference. President Trump faces the possibility of criminal liability for obstructing justice under three different theories.



Obstruction of a Proceeding. President Trump’s apparent attempts to influence, impede or obstruct congressional and grand jury proceedings represent possible violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1505, and 1512(c);



Witness Intimidation. President Trump’s misleading conduct or attempts to threaten, intimidate, and corruptly persuade witnesses may also constitute violations of Section 1512(b); and



Conspiracy. President Trump’s potential coordination with other individuals to perpetrate this obstruction of justice could be a criminal conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371."
Trump-Promises-Epic.docx,"Trump promises ‘epic’ trade deal with China, but holds off on summit with Xi Jinping for now

By David J. Lynch

April 4, 2019



President Trump touted prospects for an “epic” trade deal with China on Thursday but acknowledged that a settlement of a year-long commercial conflict remained at least a month away.

Speaking with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Trump said a trade agreement between the two countries could come “within the next four weeks” followed by an additional two weeks to polish the text.



But Trump said it was too soon to set a date for a signing summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping with negotiators still haggling over core questions, such as a proposed enforcement mechanism and the future of each side’s import tariffs.Xi also sounded an upbeat note, conveying to Trump through Liu that he wanted an early conclusion to the negotiations on the text of a bilateral trade deal.



Liu said Xi believes that “strategic leadership” was needed for the “healthy, stable development of China-U.S. ties,” according to China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency.

The two sides had reached a “new consensus” which would end a commercial spat that has unsettled relations between the world’s two largest economies, disrupted corporate supply chains and left Americans slightly poorer, according to economists.

The president’s thirst for an agreement with China has grown since the stock market began sliding from its October peak.

From the outset, his administration has been divided between advisers who fear the trade war’s impact on the economy and financial markets and those who believe a showdown with China is long overdue.

The stock market’s slide late last year increased the influence of market-friendly figures such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former executive at the investment bank Goldman Sachs.

Trade hawks such as chief negotiator Robert E. Lighthizer see the confrontation with China as perhaps Washington’s last chance to reset relations with a nation intent on supplanting the United States as the world’s technology leader.

In recent bargaining sessions, negotiators have closed the gap on provisions governing digital trade and access for American banks and financial institutions to China’s market.

The emerging accord would not erase all of the irritants in the U.S.-China relationship, but closer to be a cease-fire.

It remains unclear whether the United States will cancel some or all of the, and the president has spoken of keeping at least some tariffs in place as leverage to encourage the Chinese government to comply with an eventual agreement. China is pushing for the tariffs to be removed before it will agree to lift its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm products and industrial goods including autos. 



Tariffs on imports from China and other countries reduced U.S. real income by $1.4 billion per month and had a similar effect on countries that had retaliated against the United States, according to a study by economists David Weinstein of Columbia University, Mary Amiti of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Princeton University’s Stephen J. Redding.

He also vowed to eliminate the United States’ chronic trade deficit with China, yet saw it climb to a record $419.2 billion in 2018.



He has pressed negotiators to ensure Chinese buyers place the bulk of promised orders before the 2020 election, according to Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute whom the administration has consulted during the talks.

Those who see China as a U.S. adversary, worry the trade bargain maycarry unintended consequences."
Will-Trump_Era.docx,"Has the Trump administration begun to dismantle the Obama initiatives?

Much was made about changes to the federal school-food rules that Mr. Perdue announced in May after taking over the Department of Agriculture. But the changes (to rules set forth as part of the 2010 legislation ) are actually quite minor.

“What he said didn’t change anything, honestly,” Ms. Hayes said.

The changes fall into three areas. The first involves how much whole grain the federal government requires in school meals that qualify for at least some federal reimbursement. Under rules set by the Obama administration, buns, pasta and other foods made from grain must be at least half whole grain. Districts can apply for exceptions, which are especially popular with regional foods that are traditionally made with white flour.

“In the South, they are very worried about biscuits,” Ms. Hayes said. “In areas with large Asian populations, they are really worried about brown rice. In the Northeast, they are worried about bagels.” Whole-wheat tortillas are troublesome because they tend to crack when folded. “And everyone had a problem with pasta,” Ms. Pratt-Heavner said.

The Trump administration measures merely allow districts more time to apply for exemptions, although Mr. Perdue indicated that more changes could be in store.

Milk is another point of contention. The Obama-era rules allowed milk with 1 percent fat, but said flavored milk must be nonfat. Mr. Perdue’s change allows schools to serve flavored milk with 1 percent fat. But cafeteria administrators say 1 percent flavored milk isn’t readily available because dairy processors have already geared up to make milk in school-size containers based on the Obama regulations. Besides, they say, children have become used to nonfat chocolate milk.

The third, and perhaps most significant, change slows the imposition of new requirements that would have greatly limited salt. Districts still have to reduce sodium, but not as aggressively — a move that has won widespread support.

How much can schools rely on the federal government to improve food?

Not as much as they once did. The game is local now, with newly empowered chefs and parents joining in.

After the Obama-era rules took effect, some districts reported large drops in the number of children who participated. The food just wasn’t as tasty, students said. Many people blamed the stricter standards for fat, sugar and vegetable consumption, while others contended that the food simply needed to be prepared better.

The pushback against the federal regulations largely came from those who wanted local control, said Donna S. Martin, president of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and director of the school nutrition program for Burke County Public Schools in Waynesboro, Ga. “People want less regulation,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean people in every district in the country are not coming up with ways to make food better.”

Ann Cooper, the food service director for Boulder Valley Schools, in Colorado, calls herself “the renegade lunch lady.” She’s not hopeful that free school lunches and other food programs for the poor will get additional money under the Trump administration. In fact, their budgets will most likely be cut.

“If we want to see changes happen, they are going to come out of public-private partnerships or foundations and N.G.O.s,” she said. “People need to take matters into their own hands.”

On Wednesday, her Chef Ann Foundation , which provides grants to help schools create healthier food, will start the School Food Institute , which uses video courses to help school food-service operators and parents navigate the daunting bureaucracy of local and federal aid, with the aim of bringing from-scratch cooking back to all schools.

“We’re trying to get people to move from nuggets and Tater Tots to roast chicken,” Ms. Cooper said. “We can spend our time counting the grain in a chicken nugget as part of the whole-grain federal mandate, but should we even be talking about chicken nuggets?”"
why-no-obstruction-charge.docx,"Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find that President Donald Trump was guilty of obstruction of justice. It didn’t find him innocent, either.



Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have concluded that “the evidence is not sufficient” to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. But as a letter written by Barr to the House Judiciary Committee Sunday (summarizing the still-confidential Mueller report submitted to Barr and the Department of Justice on Friday) makes clear, that was Barr and Rosenstein’s decision — not Mueller’s.



According to Barr, Mueller didn’t draw any conclusions or make any decisions about the second part of his investigation: whether Trump obstructed justice by interfering in the investigation of Russian interference. 



Instead, Mueller simply laid out the facts of Trump’s actions with regard to the investigation. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein used those facts, as well as conversations they’d had with Mueller over the course of the investigation, to draw a conclusion about whether Trump would meet the requirements to be charged with obstruction. Their conclusion, according to Barr, is that the facts they have wouldn’t be enough to charge Trump with obstruction.



An obstruction-of-justice charge requires the government to meet a standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” for three different things:



There was “obstructive conduct;

The conduct was related to a prosecution or investigation;

The conduct was “done with corrupt intent.”



Barr is saying that he and Rosenstein didn’t see any actions described in the report that met that standard for all three elements.



Barr barely explains his reasoning here. Earlier in the letter he points out that Mueller didn’t find evidence establishing Trump himself was involved in an underlying crime regarding Russian interference, then claims that this “bears upon the President’s intent with regard to obstruction” — in other words, that if there wasn’t a crime to hide from the public or prosecutors to begin with, there wouldn’t be any need for Trump to obstruct.



We don’t know why Mueller punted on obstruction — or if he intended for Barr to make a decision instead



The critiques of Barr’s “no obstruction” declaration, from both elected Democrats and Trump-skeptical legal experts, fall into two broad categories: questions about why Mueller didn’t come to a conclusion about whether Trump could be charged with obstruction, and questions about whether it was appropriate for Barr to declare that Trump couldn’t be.



Barr’s interpretation isn’t exactly the legal consensus. So for Barr to declare that Trump didn’t meet the standard for obstruction of justice (not least because he didn’t act with “corrupt intent”) doesn’t necessarily say anything about whether another prosecutor would agree.



Eventually, at least some of the Mueller report is going to be made public. But that may not include any of the descriptions of Trump’s actions that might have constituted obstruction, or Mueller’s analysis of why they might or might not qualify.



Barr is responsible for deciding what parts of the report are released to Congress. 



The problem is that standard DOJ policies state that prosecutors shouldn’t release information to the public about “unindicted conduct” — for fear of making people seem guilty in the court of public opinion who aren’t being tried in a court of law. If Barr follows that standard, his decision that Trump shouldn’t be charged with obstruction would lead him to redact any information Mueller laid out in that regard."
Veselnitskaya-Charged-Kremlin.docx,"Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who in 2016 met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower, was charged on Tuesday in a separate case that showed her close ties to the Kremlin.

Ms. Veselnitskaya, a pivotal figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, was charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with seeking to thwart an earlier investigation into money laundering that involved an influential Russian businessman and his investment firm.

The money-laundering case was not directly related to the Trump Tower meeting. But a federal indictment returned in Manhattan seemed to confirm that Ms. Veselnitskaya had deep ties to senior Russian government officials and rekindled questions about whether the Kremlin tried to use her as an intermediary to Donald J. Trump’s campaign.

The Justice Department asked the Russian government to assist its investigation, but the Russians refused, responding with a document that purported to exonerate Russian officials and Prevezon, according to the indictment.

The indictment said Ms. Veselnitskaya secretly cooperated with a senior Russian prosecutor in drafting the document, which was later filed in federal court in Manhattan. She is charged with one count of obstruction of justice.

Ms. Veselnitskaya, 43, is believed to be in Russia, according to the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which moved to unseal the indictment on Tuesday. The office gave no indication that it expected her to be sent to Manhattan to face charges.

The new indictment again raised questions about whom Ms. Veselnitskaya was representing when she met with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and others at Trump Tower in Manhattan.

That meeting is one focus of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia’s covert operation to sway the presidential race. It was organized after an intermediary promised that Ms. Veselnitskaya would deliver documents that would incriminate Hillary Clinton.

Last April, Ms. Veselnitskaya acknowledged in an interview with NBC News that she was not merely a private lawyer, but a source of information for the Russian prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika. Now, prosecutors in Manhattan say she collaborated clandestinely with that office to write an official letter that benefited Prevezon. For years, Ms. Veselnitskaya has been regarded as a trusted insider and go-to lawyer for the Moscow regional government.

Ms. Veselnitskaya has maintained that she was acting in a private capacity when she visited Trump Tower in June 2016, shortly after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. 

Her claim has been undercut by revelations that the meeting was organized because campaign officials had been told she could offer damaging information about Ms. Clinton from the Russian government. In addition, her memo on talking points for the meeting closely matched a memo Mr. Chaika’s office had prepared for an American member of Congress, incorporating some passages verbatim.

The indictment unsealed on Tuesday could further undermine Ms. Veselnitskaya’s story, alleging that a year before the Trump Tower get-together she worked hand in glove with Russian officials to derail the money-laundering case."
Its-a-temporary-timeout.docx,"The United States and China have been here before. 



After threatening to impose potentially devastating tariffs, President Donald Trump pulled back in the wake of talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit in Japan on Saturday. 



Trump and Xi, who both tout their strong personal relationship, reached a similar agreement at the previous G-20 summit in Argentina at the end of the last year. 



But those talks ultimately failed and tariffs today are much higher than they were even as recently as early May. 



And if history is any guide to the future, the gentlemen’s agreement struck between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies over the weekend in Osaka offers no clear path to rolling back tariffs and ending a trade war that threatens to tip the global economy into recession.



“It’s a temporary timeout,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, told CNBC. “I don’t see any path to a deal and we’re stuck with 25% tariffs on $250 billion of goods.” 



Boockvar isn’t alone. The Eurasia Group, for its part, sees only a 45% chance that a trade deal gets done this year. 



And Trump is seemingly in no rush. Before sitting down with Xi on Saturday, the president made clear in an interview with Fox Business News that while he believes a deal is possible, he feels no urgency to lift tariffs.



“I’m also very happy with where we are now, ” Trump said. “We’re taking in a fortune, and frankly [it’s] not a very good thing for China, but it is a good thing for us. “



The business community by and large disagrees.



More than 600 U.S. companies, including Target and Walmart, had urged Trump not to impose additional tariffs, warning that such a move could cost 2 million American jobs.



And while business groups Saturday welcomed the renewed talks, they made clear they’re still anxiously waiting for a final deal. According to Boockvar, there’s little reason to celebrate. 



“If I’m a CEO, waiting on how this weekend was going to go, do I feel any better? If I’m in manufacturing, maybe I feel a touch better it’s not worse in the short term, but I still have to deal with this 25% tariff and the threat of more tariffs hanging over,” he said. The problem is that China sees little reason to give in to U.S. demands to change is domestic laws in order to increase intellectual property protections for foreign, particularly American, companies.



It’s a key sticking point for the Trump administration. The president’s decision in May to hike tariffs to 25% on $200 billion in Chinese goods came after Beijing allegedly back tracked on key commitments under a draft deal, including intellectual property protection. 



Indeed, China’s Vice Premier Liu He has only reiterated Beijing’s position that a deal must be balanced and “expressed in terms that are acceptable to the Chinese people and do not undermine the sovereignty and dignity of the country.”

According to Boockvar, asking China to make changes to its domestic law would be like Beijing asking the U.S. to make constitutional changes to meet its economic demands."
SAP_Doc1_Trump_Impeachment_Drama_World_Riveted_Wary.docx,"If the Trump administration has riveted the world -- a family saga of unexpected power, spiked with geopolitical tension and market upheaval -- the latest twist has international observers wary and agog as Democrats pursue an impeachment inquiry into the President.

After almost three years of turbulence that include presidential tweets insulting foreign leaders, abrupt withdrawals from international pacts and policy reversals as US officials say one thing and Trump emphatically says another, observers are almost inured to the chaos.

But current and former diplomats tell CNN that this chapter stands out, as much for what's at stake within the US as the potential fallout around the world.

""It's always something with this administration,"" said one European diplomat, ""but this feels different.""

CNN spoke to current and former envoys based in the United States as well as diplomats gathered from around the world for the 74th United Nations General Assembly to hear their countries' views and concerns as the impeachment drama unfolds.

Some said the turmoil could mean that US global leadership -- seen as waning under Trump -- will fade ever further. Others argue the President may try to draw attention from his domestic troubles by making a splash on the global stage, though few see a ""wag the dog"" scenario of war.

Some worried about the ripple effects -- that their leaders' call transcripts with Trump could also be released or that global markets could eventually be destabilized. Several said they see the impeachment battle ultimately strengthening Trump, while others marveled at just how far political discourse in the US has fallen, and how fast.

""It's fascinating to see in two years, the level of American political discussion has today collapsed,"" said Gerard Araud, former French ambassador to the US.

Referring to Trump's discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that lie at the heart of the scandal, Araud said that, ""two years ago, what he said would be constituted as a major crisis. ... Now there is a new story and new falsehood every day.""

More than half the US House of Representatives now support an impeachment investigation amid a growing controversy after the White House released a transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky.

The President delayed aid to Ukraine before he pressed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Senior White House officials then endeavored to conceal records of the call, according to the complaint by a whistleblower.

Araud said Trump's apparent quid pro quo demand in the call with Zelensky is ""totally appalling."" He added that it also means foreign leaders now know that ""whatever they say to Trump may be made public.""

""Foreign governments are now more than ever convinced that you have to be cautious with Trump, because will he make the call public. And he is totally unpredictable,"" Araud said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made clear Friday that his country finds the transcript release totally unacceptable."
DP_Doc2_Trump-Fires-Bolton.docx,"Trump fires John Bolton as national security adviser

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he had fired national security adviser John Bolton after a string of disagreements, removing one of the most hawkish voices in Trump's inner circle on a number of issues, including Taliban negotiations and China trade talks.

Trump announced on Twitter that he had asked for Bolton's resignation on Monday night, saying he had ""disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions.""

“I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning,” Trump said on Twitter.

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said that Trump had asked for Bolton's resignation on Monday night, and that it was delivered on Tuesday. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump and Bolton had not spoken on Tuesday.

Bolton himself said in a tweet that he had offered to resign Monday night, and that the president had said in response that they would ""talk about it tomorrow.""

“I offered to resign last night,"" Bolton told NBC News via text. ""He never asked for it, directly or indirectly. I slept on it, and resigned this morning.” He denied reports that he and Trump had gotten into a heated argument Monday night over the president’s plan to host Taliban leaders at Camp David.

Some National Security Council officials were caught off guard by Bolton’s firing, learning about it only when it flashed on TV screens.

Reports over the weekend that Bolton and Vice President Mike Pence disagreed with Trump's Camp David plan were the last straw for Bolton, according to two people familiar with the matter. On Monday, Pence tweeted that the stories were fake but Bolton did not — and that, according to the officials, upset Trump.

One person familiar with the breakdown between the two men said Trump didn’t want Bolton attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York with him later this month.

Asked if the disagreement over the Taliban talks led to Bolton’s dismissal, Grisham said “that there was no final straw.""

""There were several issues,"" he said. ""They had policy disagreements.”

But speaking on the condition of anonymity, one official said Afghanistan “broke open the bottom of the bag” in a relationship that had been eroding. Another official confirmed that sharp disagreement over the Afghanistan deal was the final issue that ruptured the relationship.

Bolton, known as a fierce infighter, had few loyal allies internally. He had clashed with many senior members of the administration at times, including Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

But he could also build alliances when needed. He worked closely with Pence on multiple issues, including efforts to replace Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, and aligned with Pompeo on encouraging a hard-line stance on China, said a former administration official."
