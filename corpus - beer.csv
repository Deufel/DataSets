RBC Downgrades Boston Beer Company Stock,"Another financial services firm has lowered Boston Beer Company’s stock (SAM). RBC Capital Partners today downgraded the company’s stock from an “outperform” rating to “sector perform.”
RBC analyst wrote that Boston Beer’s “volume woes have not hit a bottom just yet.” feedback from distributors on the company’s new products has been “mixed.”
“We think it is best to sit on the sidelines until we get more comfort with volume trends and incrementality of innovation,” .
As such, RBC lowered its price target to $331, down from $488.
RBC’s downgrade follows downgrades from Goldman Sachs (sell) and Bernstein (neutral) analysts.
Modi attributed the downgrade to the performance of Truly Hard Seltzer, which accounts for about half of the company’s sales. The pressure on Truly is “too much to overcome in the near term,” Modi wrote.
Hard seltzer sales are down -10% year-to-date, with dollar sales declining -15% in recent weeks in off-premise channels tracked by market research firm IRI, Modi wrote. Meanwhile, volume is down -20% over the last four-week period.
Citing Numerator data, Modi added that hard seltzer household penetration is now at 29.2% in the latest week, down 80 basis points compared to the start of the year and down 100 bps compared to mid-March. Meanwhile, repeat rates “have fared better,” but are also down compared to March (down 20 bps).
Although buy rates of hard seltzer are still up low-single-digits year-over-year in recent weeks, it “continues to see a sequential deceleration,” Modi wrote.
“While category [comparisons] should get easier, transitioning to MSD-HSD% [mid-single digits to high-single digits] comps for the remainder of the year starting in late June-early July, the current category velocities and two year trends continue to decelerate on an underlying basis making it more difficult to support a reversal of trends,” Modi wrote. “Truly’s share of hard seltzer has also regressed in the last 4 weeks and the overall hard seltzer category continues to lose share of overall beer.”
Boston Beer management had forecast 0-10% growth for the overall hard seltzer segment in 2022. Year-to-date in IRI tracked channels, the segment is declining -10%.
“Given seltzers’ recent performance, we see the category underachieving that target, even as comps ease,” Modi wrote.
“SAM’s shipment/depletion guidance of +4% to +10% implies ~HSD% depletion growth in the back half of the year as tracked channel underlying growth continues to decline,” Modi continued. “We ultimately see pressure to SAM’s FY’22 guidance due to Truly’s drag to overall growth. For the year, we see negative depletion growth as a reasonable outcome. With volumes in negative territory for the year, we acknowledge the long run growth trajectory of the business has greater uncertainty as seltzer/Truly velocities continue to slow and the company’s recent innovations remain unproven.”
On the bright side, Twisted Tea dollar sales have accelerated, up around 30% in tracked channels over the last four weeks, with the brand posting “strong growth in both ACV and total points of distribution.”
Boston Beer has received credit for its ‘needle-moving innovation over the year,” but it has has historically led to “boom-bust cycles as the company gets distribution and then repeat fades due to increased competition.” Although Boston Beer’s innovations this year have “done well gaining trial,” they have “struggled to be incremental overall.”
“Truly Margarita has reached ~4% share of hard seltzer, but share has come at the expense of previous innovations like Truly Lemonade, Punch, and Tea,” Modi wrote. “Our channel checks indicate Truly Vodka Seltzer is set to launch in August, which is late to capitalize on the peak summer selling season and support Truly growth needed this year. Bevy, which was launched this year, will be discontinued. Hard Mtn Dew has driven strong trial on limited distribution, but it remains too early to gauge ultimate potential.
“In the long term, we like SAM’s ability to innovate within the broader Beyond Beer space (seltzers, FMBs, RTDs, & ciders) but believe SAM will be in ‘prove it mode’ until clarity emerges regarding seltzer’s stabilization and innovation performance, both of which we believe will take time,” he continued.
RBC anticipates Boston Beer will lower its guidance due to pressures on Truly Hard Seltzer and the overall segment’s trends.
“With hard seltzer sales trends down double digits in recent periods, SAM’s category target of 0-10% growth is optimistic,” Modi wrote. “While we acknowledge the category [comparisons] get easier later in the year, underlying growth trends are also decelerating and we would find it most prudent if SAM guided to depletions continuing to decline on an underlying basis, which could be – MSD to HSD%. Given the cost environment we would also expect pricing to trend towards the higher end of their guided range 3-5%.”

"Rhode Island based craft brewery and distillery, further expands its’ brand portfolio","Newport, R.I. — Newport Craft Brewing & Distilling Co., a Newport, Rhode Island based craft brewery and distillery, further expands its’ brand portfolio with the acquisition of Radiant Pig Beer Company. With Braven Brewing Company and Radiant Pig Beer Company, Newport Craft’s stable of products now includes 26 authentic beers, and over 10 craft spirit and cocktail labels.
Since launching in 2013, Radiant Pig has created innovative, high-quality beers with colorful names and stories inspired by the art, music, and culture of New York City. Radiant Pig’s year round favorites include its flagship IPA “Save the Robots”, “TV Party” a New England pale ale, “Own the Night” Hazy IPA, “It Ain’t Easy” Double IPA, “No Half Steppin” Single Hop IPA, and “Junior”, a session IPA.
“In order to continue to deliver the level of quality expected of Radiant Pig and to satisfy the ever-growing demand, it was important for me to find a partner with the same vision and commitment to quality and authenticity, and I found that in Newport Craft. Getting to know CEO Brendan O’Donnell and the Newport Craft team over the past year, we discovered that we not only shared a vision but a commitment to common values. After countless discussions with Brendan, I understood Newport Craft’s unwavering commitment to the craft brewing industry and where it sees itself on the regional and national brewing stage. I am thrilled about the partnership and the future of Radiant Pig,” said Rob Pihl, founder, master brewer and creative force behind Radiant Pig Beer Company.
In addition to taking an equity stake in the Company, Rob will join a Newport Craft team that has over 100 years of combined manufacturing, brewing, and distilling experience and will become the Company’s Brewmaster and Brand Ambassador. New addition Jessica Woodcome, who previously represented Magic Hat, Labatt USA, Genesee, Imperial, and Seagram’s Escape, will lead the Radiant Pig sales team with the single focus of expanding the brand’s presence on the shelves and in the taps in CT, MA and RI. Jessica will join the Company’s completely rebuilt sales team led by David Hall, Northeast Sales Manager, and Tarcizio DaSilvia, Tri State Sales Manager. Adding the Radiant Pig beers to the Company’s production schedule that already includes the Braven Brewing and Newport Craft portfolios will push the Company’s production to 10,000 barrels by the end of the year and 25,000 barrels by 2022. Newport Craft has Radiant Pig in the tank and production and distribution will continue without interruption. Since taking over Newport Craft in 2017, Brendan and his team have solidified the Company’s spot as a leader on the New England craft brewing stage.
The Company has focused on its product lines, introducing new products, upgrading and expanding its manufacturing facility, and pursuing strategic acquisitions. Additionally, the Company is currently aging close to 1,000 barrels of Thomas Tew Rum and Sea Fog Whiskey; and has added gin, amaro, Newport Vodka, rye whisky, and reserve and spiced rums to its portfolio of spirits. Under Brendan’s leadership the Company has doubled its’ top line revenue, more than tripled its’ workforce, increased distribution to six states (CT, MA, NY, PA, RI, and ME), and has grown its social media platform to nearly 50,000 followers.
Newport Craft is now the largest combined brewing and distilling company in Rhode Island by production. The Thomas Tew Rum brand has been ranked amongst the top ten craft rums in America by USA Today, is a featured rum at Walt Disney World’s EPCOT, can be found on the top shelf of over 500 restaurants and bars and is the Official Rum of the New York Mets. Additionally, Newport Craft’s portfolio of beers, including Braven Brewing Company, are sold at the New York Mets’ Brooklyn and Queens area ballparks. Behind the strength of the Braven Brewing and Radiant Pig brands, Newport Craft will explore opportunities to open a tasting room in the New York City market.
To increase its brewing and distilling capacity and to meet the heightened market demand for its products, Newport Craft is in the process of doubling the production capacity of its current Newport, RI facility. The project will break ground in Summer 2020 with a projected 12 month build time. Once completed, the state-of-the-art facility will allow the Company to increase its brewing capacity with an eye towards 100,000 barrels per year with room to grow. The expanded facility will also allow the Company to separate the brewing and distilling operations. Not only will this new facility create the space for expansion and increased production, it will become a premier tourist attraction and venue allowing for each of the Company’s products to be displayed, tasted and enjoyed. The Company anticipates doubling its Rhode Island community workforce to meet production demands."
Craft Breweries forming a partnership with NA,"Two St. Louis craft breweries are forming a partnership.
Schlafly Beer and non-alcoholic beer maker WellBeing Brewing Co. announced a joint venture Thursday that will see Schlafly manage sales and production of WellBeing’s brands while also working with the company’s existing contract brewing and distribution partners.
Partnering with WellBeing gives Schlafly access to a portfolio of non-alcoholic beer brands with shared local roots.
In a statement, Schlafly CEO Fran Caradonna told Brewbound that “there has been no change in ownership or control of WellBeing or Schlafly.”
“The companies are working shoulder to shoulder as partners, each in their respective areas of strength, and sharing the profits,” she added.
“This is truly a joint venture. It allows us to scale our brand to a new level,” added WellBeing co-founder and CEO Jeff Stevens in a press release. “We can utilize Schlafly’s operational resources, yet still grow our brand under our vision. As craft brewers look for ways to adapt to a changing consumer landscape, non-alcoholic offerings are becoming essential. We believe that we can be a driver of innovation across the adult non-alcoholic space.”
WellBeing’s brands will be sold throughout Schlafly’s distribution footprint, which covers Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.
Caradonna told Brewbound that the two companies’ distribution “footprints have some overlap, but WellBeing’s distribution is wider while Schlafly’s is deeper.”
“We each use different wholesalers in our home market, but we won’t be making any changes as a result of this joint venture,” she added. “Our goal is to create and maintain the most effective distribution for both Schlafly and WellBeing, and sometimes that might mean they’re together in the same house and other times it may not.”
WellBeing will be able to leverage Schlafly’s management and operational capabilities, while maintaining its focus on innovation, overseeing product development, marketing, content, publicity and its e-commerce sales.
WellBeing’s offerings will continue to be contract produced at O’Fallon Brewery in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and New Realm Brewing’s Virginia Beach, Virginia, location. Schlafly will produce some WellBeing offerings in the future, but the company does “not plan to move all production here,” according to Caradonna.
“I expect increased sales will keep us all quite busy making WellBeing NA beers,” she added.
Schlafly will also manage back-of-house functions such as inventory, raw materials procurement, logistics and sales.
The JV is in effect immediately, with WellBeing beers brewed by Schlafly expected to hit retailers later this year.
Year-to-date through June 26, dollar sales of non-alcoholic beer are up +13.4%, to nearly $117.5 million, in multi-outlet and convenience stores tracked by market research firm IRI. NA beer’s share of beer category dollars have also increased .08%, to .61%. However, off-premise scans only capture part of the sales picture for NA beer producers, who are able to leverage e-commerce channels to sell their offerings directly to consumers. NA producers are also making headway into on-premise retailers, with Athletic Brewing recently gaining more than 1,000 placements at Buffalo Wild Wings stores.

Anheuser-Busch InBev Sells CA distributership,"Anheuser-Busch InBev has struck a deal to sell its Oakland, California-based wholly owned distributor to two independent wholesalers, Markstein Sales Company and Matagrano, Inc.
Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close July 29, were not disclosed.
“The strength of our wholesaler system is a critical element as we drive to deliver industry innovation and growth, and that includes both our industry-leading independent wholesaler network as well as our Anheuser-Busch facilities,” A-B chief commercial officer Kyle Norrington said in a press release.
“Anheuser-Busch’s owned distribution operations are a competitive advantage as they help us to develop future leaders, to test, pilot, and learn in the market, and ultimately to become better partners to our independent wholesalers and retail customers,” he continued. “We are pleased to transition our Oakland operations to two strong wholesaler partners, and we look forward to working together to accelerate our momentum in Northern California.”
Antioch-headquartered Markstein will sell A-B products in Oakland, while South San Francisco-based Matagrano will sell the portfolio in northern Santa Clara County and San Jose. Both distributors will maintain their current warehouse operations.
The added territory is a boon for Markstein, which received a termination notice from Constellation Brands earlier this year along with Visalia-based Bueno Beverage Company. Together, the two sold about 4 million case equivalents of Constellation products (Modelo, Corona, Pacifico).
“As a woman-owned, family-owned business with 102 years of local experience, we are proud of our long-term partnership with Anheuser-Busch as they continually demonstrate a willingness to support and work with their independent wholesalers as true partners,” president Laura Markstein said in the release. “We appreciate the opportunity to integrate Anheuser-Busch’s Oakland territory and members of its workforce into our operations and to continue bringing Anheuser-Busch’s leading portfolio of brands to our retail customers in this large and diverse community we call home.”
AB ONE Oakland joined A-B’s wholly owned distributor division in 2015, when it was acquired as Horizon Beverage from former owner Ces Butner, who now owns Speakeasy Ale & Lagers. A-B sold the Oakland distribution facility in May 2020 to Westcore Properties, an industrial real estate developer, for $40.5 million, according to CoStar.
That sale was the first in a string of deals AB ONE engaged in during the summer and fall of 2020. In July 2020, it swapped territories with Heimark Distributing in Southern California. In September 2020, A-B sold its wholly owned Colorado branch to Norcross, Georgia-based Eagle Rock Distributing. Two weeks later, A-B acquired Los Angeles-based Ace Beverage. A-B named Anson Frericks president of AB ONE last fall.
The moves are part of A-B’s “ongoing efforts to ensure the strongest possible route-to-market and the highest level of services for its retail customers across the different markets in which it operates,” according to the release.
“Over the last several years we have worked to structure our organization to drive growth and create value for our customers, consumers and communities,” A-B VP of business and wholesaler development Bob Tallett said in the release. “Northern California is an important market, so it was critical for us to find trusted partners that have a clear vision for this business. We will continue to work closely with Markstein and Matagrano to prioritize Anheuser-Busch employees and ensure a smooth and efficient transition.”
In addition to A-B products, Markstein’s portfolio includes offerings from Firestone Walker, Sierra Nevada, Lost Coast, Shiner, Deschutes and Fort Point. Matagrano’s portfolio includes offerings from Stone, Heineken USA, Firestone Walker, Deschutes and 21st Amendment.
A-B also operates AB ONE branches in Southern California, Oregon, Washington, Oklahoma, Ohio, Massachusetts and New York.
During Beer Business Daily’s Beer Industry Summit in January, North American zone CEO Brendan Whitworth noted that AB ONE branches at the time accounted for about 7% of the company’s volume.
A-B is limited to shipping no more than 10% of its volume through AB ONE, so the sale of AB ONE Oakland will drive that number down. It was as high as 9% in 2016, according to a letter the National Beer Wholesalers Association (NBWA) sent the Department of Justice (DOJ) to comment on the proposed A-B/SABMiller merger. At the time the NBWA called into question the veracity of A-B’s self-reported volume flowing through its own network.

CEO's Call on Repeal of Aluminum Tariffs,"CEOs Call on President to Repeal Section 232 Aluminum Tariffs
Leaders of the four largest U.S. beer manufacturers sent President Joe Biden a letter on July 1 calling for the repeal of the Section 232 tariffs imposed on aluminum by former President Donald Trump, saying “tariff relief results in inflation relief.”
The letter was signed by Gavin Hattersley, president and CEO of Molson Coors Beverage Company and chairman and acting president of the Beer Institute; Brendan Whitworth, CEO of Anheuser-Busch InBev’s North America zone; Jim Sabia, EVP and president of Constellation Brands’ beer division; and Maggie Timoney, CEO of Heineken USA.
They wrote that the tariffs continue to “burden breweries of all sizes.”
“Eliminating the tariffs will alleviate pressure and allow us to continue our vital role as strong contributors to this nation’s economy,” they wrote.
The CEOs added that the beer industry uses more than 41 billion aluminum cans a year, and since the implementation of the tariffs in 2018, the U.S. beverage industry has paid more than $1.4 billion in Section 232 tariffs. The tariffs have led to increased production costs for aluminum end-users and higher prices for consumers.
“Just as concerning is that of the $1.4 billion ostensibly paid in tariffs, 92% did not go to the U.S. Treasury,” they wrote. “We applaud your administration’s efforts to negotiate lifting tariffs off individual countries. However, those efforts to provide economic relief to American consumers have no effect if end-users – such as U.S. brewers – are charged a tariff-burdened price regardless of whether the metal should be tariffed based on its content or origin.”
The CEOs called on the Biden Administration to investigate “aluminum market manipulation and benchmarking” and “bring much needed transparency to the marketplace and relief to end-users and American families.”"
Modern Times Sale Take another turn,"The sale of Modern Times took another turn Thursday with the ultimate acquirer of the San Diego brewery still in question.
BX MT BAMF LLC, an affiliate of Anaheim, California-based Brewery X, which was awarded the ability to acquire Modern Times during a June 17 auction, has “elected not to complete the sale process,” according to a press release issued Thursday by Modern Times.
With Brewery X apparently out of the picture, Kihei, Hawaii-based Maui Brewing Company is next in line as the court-approved backup bidder, with a $15.3 million bid.
Although Maui has moved into the buyer’s seat, there remains a long way to go before the sale process closes. Maui chief operating officer Scott Metzger told Brewbound “there are a lot of legal complications as we figure out who the ultimate buyer of Modern Times will be.”
The sale is expected to close in October 2022, according to the release.
How We Got Here
The $20 million bid from Brewery X – via BX MT BAMF – to acquire Modern Times, with a 14-day closing window, was approved by the court during a June 24 hearing. The brewery backed out of the sale on July 1, according to Modern Times.
“This was an unexpected development in this process,” Modern Times CEO Jennifer Briggs said in a press release. “I am looking forward to working with [Maui Brewing] and finalizing the sale process and transitioning the business.
“The Modern Times Brewing team of employees and professional advisors engaged with BX MT BAMF, LLC representatives in a sprint-like fashion to meet the tight transition timeline for the closing date of July 8, 2022,” she continued. “This last-minute change is abrupt, yet it gives us the opportunity to be even more methodical. It allows [Maui Brewing] the time to finalize their acquisition process per their asset purchase agreement and how it will be additive to our craft brewing community.”
“Distressed sale processes often experience some turbulence, including on the buyer side,” Paul Buie, managing director of Onyx Asset Advisors, the company overseeing the sale of Modern Times, said in the release. “Thanks to the strong interest that developed in the Modern Times’ sale process, the Receiver was able to select and confirm [Maui Brewing] as the backup bidder at the June 17th auction.”
A Rollercoaster Sales Process
The sale process has taken several turns since Modern Times’ primary lender Zions Bancorporation (California Bank & Trust) initiated the court-approved sale process following the brewery defaulting on three loans totaling $12.9 million.
Last month, a wrench was thrown into the auction process when Modern Times’ court-appointed receiver, Thomas Hebrank, named Brewery X the winning bidder, even though MTD Asset Acquisition (MTD) made a higher offer at $20.1 million. MTD’s offer included a 120-day close period and the request for Hebrank to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the closing.
Michael B. Lubic, MTD’s attorney, filed an objection to the selection of Brewery X’s bid and submitted a new offer of $21 million with a 30-day close period and no Chapter 11 option on the grounds that the auction rules specified that non-monetary aspects, such as time to close, were not going to be considered as part of the auction.
“The auction was not conducted in accordance with the auction rules and the procedure was not fair, not commercially reasonable, and not designed to maximize value for the creditors,” Lubic wrote in the objection.
According to MTD’s asset purchase agreement included in Hebrank’s declaration, MTD is a Delaware-based LLC that lists K. Bagby Taylor as its president. Kurt Bagby Taylor is the founder of Next Glass, the parent company of Untappd, BeerAdvocate and Hop Culture; he exited the company following its sale in March 2020.
His father, George Taylor, is the CEO of Wilmington, North Carolina-based TRU Colors Brewery. According to notes in the auction bid log, MTD was bidding on behalf of TRU Colors. However, Kurt Taylor told WilmingtonBiz TRU Colors was not connected to the auction.
“The plan was to work through some of the challenges that Modern Times had,” Kurt Taylor told the business publication. “I really like the brand that they had built and thought that there was a lot of potential there to revive it. The employees there I thought were excellent – really skilled and good at their craft. My hope was to stabilize the business in Southern California and then potentially look to expand beyond there.”
Kurt Taylor has not responded to Brewbound’s request for comment.

North Carolina relaxes liquor Tax,"North Carolina Nixes Bill to Expand RTD Market Access
A bill that would have expanded market access for spirits-based, ready-to-drink (RTD) canned cocktails in North Carolina failed to advance in the state Legislature before it adjourned on July 1.
House Bill 904 would have created a new legal definition for RTDs between 0.5%-9.5% ABV as “low alcohol beverage coolers” that categorized them as fortified wine, paving the way for the spirits-based drinks to be sold outside of state-run liquor stores. North Carolina is a control state in which boards run by the county or municipal governments oversee the sale of spirits.
The Beer Institute (BI), the trade group that represents the nation’s larger brewers, called it “the latest in a string of similar moves that stand up for America’s beer businesses.”
“Lawmakers in North Carolina are sending a message to hard liquor: beer and liquor are not the same,” BI director of public affairs Alex Davidson said in a press release. “Large liquor companies don’t need special tax hand-outs, especially after recording more than $3.8 billion in profits last year. North Carolina lawmakers are right to focus their efforts on domestic job creators and working families who need help as they recover from the pandemic and face rising inflation.”
The spirits industry is advocating for lower excise taxes and expanded market access for RTDs, which have similar ABV levels to beer and products categorized as beer such as hard seltzers. Bills that would have achieved these goals stalled or failed during the legislative sessions in several states this year, including Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Washington and West Virginia, according to the BI.
Last month, Vermont enacted a law that created a separate class for RTDs up to 12% ABV, allowing them to be sold at licensed beer and wine retailers. In addition to expanding market access, Vermont also lowered excise tax from $7.68 per gallon to $1.10 per gallon, twice the rate for wine and quadruple the rate for beer.
In Michigan and Nebraska, which lowered RTD excise tax rates, retail prices for the products increased 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively, the BI said.

NJ Lawmakers backpeddle on Taproom restrictions,"NJ Lawmaker to Attempt Roll Back of Taproom Event Limitations
Following the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control’s (NJABC) move to enforce special conditions that restrict craft breweries’ ability to host events and offer food, state Sen. Michael Testa has announced he will introduce a bill to counter the restrictions.
The conditions – which Testa called “disastrous and destructive” in a press release – were introduced in 2019, but went unenforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The NJABC said they would begin enforcing the conditions during the 2022-2023 license cycle, which began on July 1.
“In my opinion, the ABC fell far short treating our local breweries fairly, which we must address with new legislation to aid these small businesses,” Testa said in the release. “These breweries, like most small businesses, suffered under Governor Murphy’s pandemic shutdowns and restrictions. To increase their burden with these new rules only adds insult to injury.”
Under the conditions, limited brewery licensees cannot coordinate with any food truck or pop-up food vendor to offer meals on brewery premises and are restricted to 25 public and 52 private on-site events per year, among other limitations. The 25 public events include activities such as trivia, paint nights, live music and yoga classes – all of which are regular occurrences at breweries nationwide. Breweries must notify NJABC 10 days prior to an event
Testa said he plans to introduce the legislation in several weeks during the next Senate quorum.

RTDs show strong growth,"Drizly: RTDs, Rice Lagers and BeatBox Big Winners in May
Ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages (RTDs) had another strong month on Drizly, continuing to drive summer sales growth on the e-commerce alcohol delivery platform, with “no signs of stopping,” according to Liz Paquette, Drizly’s head of consumer insights.
As previously reported, RTDs had a particularly strong Memorial Day weekend, passing hard seltzers in share of sales for the first time on the platform. The segment recorded a 4.8% share of sales on Drizly during the holiday, while hard seltzer recorded a 4.4% share.
RTD variety packs from brands such as Gallo’s High Noon Sun Sips, Anheuser-Busch InBev’s (A-B’s) Cutwater Spirits and Nütrl Vodka, led growth in the segment over the month, “indicating that summer get-togethers are starting early,” according to Drizly’s May consumer insights report.
Drizly also noted that consumers were ordering earlier in the week. Sunday (12%), Monday (13%) and Tuesday (13%) each gained three points order share month-over-over, while Monday and Tuesday also gained share year-over-year.
Other beyond beer brands recorded significant growth in the month, including BeatBox Beverages’ hard “party punch,” which had the largest year-over-year sales increase on Drizly, driven by flavors Fruit Punch, Tropical Punch and Blue Razzberry. Strainge Beast Hard Kombucha was one of the fastest growing beer brands year-over-year in May, with flavors such as Ginger, Lemon, and Hibiscus; Passion Fruit, Hops, and Blood Orange; and Blueberry, Acai, and Sweet Basil.
Rice lagers recorded the most growth in beer out of all other subsegments, led by brands such as Asahi, Orion Breweries and Berryessa Brewing Co. – a trend that carried over from March.

New ECommerce Platform launches,"Bevana has launched a new e-commerce platform, allowing consumers in 42 states to buy and ship craft beer directly from producers around the world.
Bevana – formerly Community Brewing Ventures or CBV – was formed in 2020 to help small- and medium-sized craft beer producers get to market. Its portfolio of brands include Bay Cannon Beer Company (Tampa, Florida); Bold Mariner Brewing Company (Norfolk, Virginia); D9 Brewing Co. (Cornelius, North Carolina); Fatty’s Beer Works (Charleston, South Carolina); Side Hustle Brews & Spirits (United Arab Emirates); Steam Theory Brewing Co. (Dallas, Texas); Unknown Brewing (Newton, North Carolina); UpDog Kombucha (Newton, North Carolina); and Urban Brew Labs (Chicago, Illinois).
“Rather than buying inventory through the traditional three-tier system,” Bevana’s new platform “works directly with its partners” to connect drinkers to products, “without passing on hidden costs and fees to the customer,” according to a press release.
“Buying alcohol online has always been a frustrating, expensive process for many customers,” Matthew Juaire, Bevana’s director of e-commerce, said in the release. “Individual beverage companies can often only ship within their home state, and it’s a significant burden for them to manage even then. For other marketplaces, oftentimes they either have to warehouse enormous amounts of products that they may never be able to sell, or they have to buy it directly from a retailer. Either way, that’s a lot of added expense that usually gets passed on to the customer.
“With Bevana, we can offer an unbeatable selection of different beverages without that extra step,” he continued. “That gives us the ability to connect people and makers not only more affordably, but with better quality control and better service, wherever we ship.”

Cannabis Consolidation,"Global cannabis giant Tilray Brands announced amendments this week to its debt acquisition agreement with HEXO Corp, giving Tilray a 10.8% discount on the principal balance of HEXO.
In March, Tilray announced it would be taking on $211 million of debt from fellow Canadian-based cannabis producer HEXO, placing Tilray in a “significant equity ownership position.” Per the agreement, HEXO will pay Tilray an $18 million annual fee for “advisory services.” The “strategic alliance” is projected to create $80 million in “shared cost-saving synergies” for the two companies within two years, according to a press release.
The company reported that $185 million remain outstanding from HEXO’s debt, as well as accrued and unpaid interest. Through the amended agreement, Tilray will pay 89.2% of the outstanding principal balance. The agreement is expected to close July 15, although the amended agreements “extend the outside date for closing the transaction to August 1,” according to the release.
The two companies are still working on a commercial agreement, which would guarantee the production of HEXO products through Tilray (as a third party) and would require HEXO to source its cannabis products for international markets (outside U.S. and Canada) exclusively from Tilray. Tilray will also nominate two directors to HEXO’s board of directors, and one “board observer.”
“The strategic alliance with Tilray Brands accelerates HEXO’s operational turnaround and unlocks capital to expand our market leadership globally,” Charlie Bowman, HEXO’s president and CEO, said in the release. “The partnership is an essential next step in improving our capital structure, and we’re confident that the synergies realized will reset the industry.”
Tilray owns over 20 brands across 30 countries, including beverage-alcohol suppliers SweetWater Brewing, Green Flash, Alpine Beer Company, and Breckenridge Distillery. CEO Irwin Simon discussed some of Tilray’s ambitions on Brewbound Frontlines earlier this year. Watch here.

Busch Family Brewing launching new Beer,"ST. LOUIS, Missouri – Attention beer fans! The much anticipated launch of two new beers created by an heir of the Busch Family legacy is here. Busch Family Brewing & Distilling Company is proud to announce that Adolphus German Style Pilsner and Gussie Bavarian Lager are now available at select pubs and restaurants in the St. Louis area.
Adolphus Pilsner is crafted with a keen eye on the traditional German technique of decoction. Decoction is when a portion of the mash is pulled off, boiled in another vessel, and then mixed back into the mash. This process accentuates the pilsner malt character. Rather than the water cracker characteristic it typically lends to a beer, it takes on more of a bread crust aspect in addition to darkening the wort and final beer. Adolphus Pilsner is made with German noble hops which lend a gentle floral, woodsy character. A lager yeast that accentuates the malt sweetness is used and the beer is allowed to clarify naturally over time.
Gussie Bavarian is a clean and smooth lager. It boasts a balance between the deep malt flavors and the hop bitterness. Hop character is restrained herbal, spicy, floral notes. This tasty brew pairs well with foods where it can cut through spice heat or fat (i.e. hamburger, cheese). It’s an ideal accompaniment for cheese dishes, especially ones with Colby. It works well as a counter to acidic foods.
“My family and I are carrying on the tradition of brewing some of the finest beers in the country,” says Billy Busch, owner and founder, along with his family, of Busch Family Brewing and Distilling.  “As you may have guessed, Adolphus Pilsner is in honor of my great grandfather, and Gussie Pilsner is an homage to my dad.” He continues, “we’re excited about the future and are eager to introduce more brands.”
Beer lovers can now enjoy the inaugural brews at the following eateries and pubs, with more locations being added daily.

PepsiCo planning more Alcoholic drinks in the future,"PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta was asked just one question about the carbonated soft drink maker’s plans in the beverage alcohol space, during the company’s Q1 2022 earnings call Tuesday.
Asked about the launch of Hard MTN Dew in partnership with Boston Beer Company, and the company’s longer-term plans in the category, Laguarta said PepsiCo is “testing and learning at a fast speed” and “Boston Beer is learning how to market and improve the products,” as well.
“We’re also learning about how to distribute and sell low-alcohol beverages, which obviously have a lot of restrictions at the state and even municipality level,” Laguarta said of PepsiCo’s Blue Cloud Distribution branch. “We’re having to train our people in the right way and so on. So there’s a lot of test and learning, very encouraging learnings actually as we see in the consumers.”
Hard MTN Dew is “generating a lot of excitement” and garnering “a lot of initial trial,” Laguarta said. The product was initially launched in Iowa, Tennessee and Florida, followed by Arkansa, Oklahoma and Minnesota. The brand is expected to be in 15 states by the end of summer.
“As always, in these circumstances, we have to wait and see repeats and see really where the business stabilizes,” Laguarta said. “But I would say, good learnings for the organization. It’s still very early in the process of building the infrastructure and the talent base and pretty good response from the consumer.”
During Boston Beer’s Q1 earnings call last week, CEO Dave Burwick said Hard MTN Dew has received “the highest trial I’ve ever seen, ever, ever,” with a 27% share of flavored malt beverages (FMBs) in off-premise channels.
PepsiCo’s interest in bev-alc won’t stop at Hard MTN Dew, Laguarta said. He said to look for the company to “create new exciting products that will go through this platform in the future.”
“[A]s we learn more about the consumer, together with our partners, we’ll be able to innovate meaningfully in this category,” he added. “But as I said, too early, too early yet to call it a huge success.”

New Jersey craft breweries hit hard with legislative restrictions,"New Jersey craft breweries are “disheartened” after the state Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (NJABC) moved forward on July 1 with special conditions for brewery license holders that limit brewers’ ability to host food trucks and events or sell beverages not produced on site, among other privileges.
The conditions – which the Brewers Guild of New Jersey (BGNJ) described as “discouraging” and their enforcement as “extremely problematic” – went into effect in 2019, but were largely unenforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interim, the BGNJ attempted to negotiate revisions to the special ruling, but to no avail, executive director Eric Orlando wrote in a statement.
“Our organization offered several proposed changes in the last two years to regulators with the hopes that they would become part of these conditions in the interim and become the foundation of more permanent industry regulations moving forward,” he said.
“Instead, breweries in the state, still struggling from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now also impacted by record inflation and ongoing supply chain issues, will be limited in their ability this summer and the foreseeable future to serve their customers and provide the types of local, community-centric hospitality options many in our state have become accustomed to and thoroughly enjoy,” Orlando continued.
Many Garden State craft breweries operate under the state’s limited brewery license, which allows them to brew, sell and distribute up to 300,000 barrels annually, as well as sell beer directly to the public on the brewery premises. However, brewery patrons are required by law to to take a tour of the brewery in order to drink on-site. To-go sales are capped at 15.5 gallons per person. Limited license breweries cannot operate a restaurant or sell food.
Limited licensees pay a graduated annual fee based on production:
$1,250 per year for volume up to 50,000 barrels;
$2,500 per year for volume between 50,001-100,000 barrels;
$5,000 per year for volume between 100,001-200,000 barrels;
$7,500 per year for volume between 200,001-300,000 barrels.
The limited brewery license took its current shape in 2012, before the taproom business model boom transformed craft breweries into destinations for on-premise consumption. NJABC observed that “the activities and practice of the limited breweries vary across the state and, in some instances, exceed the privileges of the limited brewery license.” In an attempt to balance the concerns of breweries and other licensed on- and off-premise retailers, NJABC issued special considerations on brewery licenses in the fall of 2018, but walked them back after what it called “a media controversy.”
NJABC took the next few months to consult with the state’s two brewers guilds (the BGNJ and the New Jersey Brewers Association), the New Jersey Licensed Beverage Association, the New Jersey Restaurant Association, the New Jersey Liquor Store Alliance and state legislators. That “informal fact finding” led to the creation of the 2019 conditions, which NJABC credited to “the plain language” of the statute that created limited brewery licenses and a “review of its legislative history.”
“The division cannot escape its original interpretation that the 2012 amendments to the limited brewery statute were enacted for the purpose of promoting the manufacture of craft beers and creating a demand for these products through limited consumption privileges on the brewery premises,” NJABC wrote.
Rather, NJABC envisioned that consumption in taprooms with limited brewery licenses would lead to a beer-enthusiastic public that would seek out beers from local breweries at on-premise retailers. It developed the 2019 conditions to create a taproom culture that would serve as a stepping stone instead of a final destination.
“The division believes the activities permitted under the 2019 special ruling strike a fair and appropriate balance between the interests of full retail license holders, such as restaurants and bars, and the craft brewing industry,” an NJABC spokesperson told Brewbound, adding that the division seeks to “work with all licensees to promote a fair and robust alcoholic beverage industry in New Jersey.”
However, the discrepancy between the nature of the licenses that breweries can obtain and those that on- and off-premise retailers need has created tension between the two groups.
“We have a very restrictive liquor license system and our liquor laws were created basically in the Prohibition era,” Scott Wells, director of sales at Carlstadt-based Bolero Snort and BGNJ board member, told Brewbound. “The availability of liquor licenses is tied back to the population of each municipality. Municipalities choose to not issue the full amount of licenses that they’re entitled to. Most of the licenses have been in families for generations, and the resale value on them at this point has reached $1 million to $2 million.”
By comparison, limited brewery licenses are manufacturing licenses given by the state and are not limited by population.
Bolero Snort sells about 95% of its volume through the three-tier distribution system. The brewery self-distributes within New Jersey and also ships to New York City (SKI), Massachusetts (Craft Collective), Pennsylvania (31st and Wharton) and Georgia (Modern Hops), according to its website. But, unlike Bolero Snort, some Garden State breweries do nearly all of their business over their own bars. A perception persists among retailers that most craft breweries with taprooms are competition instead of suppliers, which “creates an us versus them mentality,” Wells said.
“In other parts of the state, the bar owners aren’t buying beer the customers want,” he said. “They complain about ‘Oh, the brewery down the road stole my customers.’ Yeah, but you’re not offering your customers any local craft beer options. You’ve got the same distribution stuff on that you’ve had for the past 100 years and you won’t even take a meeting with the local guys. What do you expect the customers to do?”
So as not to funnel business away from restaurants and into taprooms, limited brewery license holders are “explicitly prohibited from selling food or operating a restaurant,” according to the 2019 conditions. This prohibition extends to inviting food trucks or pop-up vendors to set up on brewery grounds, which is particularly vexing to Wells.
“It’s really the most insulting thing on the list of conditions,” he said, adding that servers are required to become certified through TIPS (Training for Intervention ProcedureS) or a similar program, the training process for which is “three-and-a-half hours of ‘feed them, feed them, feed them, feed them, feed them.’”
Under their licenses, breweries are limited to 25 “on-premises special events” – roughly two per month – which NJABC defines as:
“Trivia/quizzo/game night;
Arts and crafts/paint and sip;
Live music/DJs/open microphone;
Games of skill;
Educational events and seminars;
Political fundraisers that are not organized by a not-for-profit, as defined in N.J.A.C. 12:2-5.1(a);
Movie or theatrical events;
Animal adoption events, to the extent permitted by local ordinance; or
Yoga or other similar types of classes.”
To host an event, breweries must notify NJABC 10 days in advance and must include:
“Description of special event to occur on licensed premises;
Date and time of event;
Estimated number of people in attendance;
Cover charge for event, if any;
Security for event to ensure no consumption by individuals under the legal age and no pass-offs; and
Name, address, and other contact information for outside vendor providing entertainment if any; and
Statement indicated that this is the [number] on-premises special event held on the licensed premises in the present calendar year.”
If breweries are selling event tickets, the “cover charge shall not include any free or discounted alcoholic beverages, and participants shall not be required to purchase any number of alcoholic beverages as a condition entry,” the conditions read.
“The new conditions have severely limited what we can do in our spectacular brewery with no true rhyme or reason to what is actually trying to be accomplished,” Jeremy Lees, president of Flounder Brewing in Hillsborough, told Brewbound.
Flounder, which moved into its current location – a 250-year-old repurposed Dutch barn – last summer, has found success with yoga classes and a meet-the-brewer session, but has decided to abandon both event series in light of the conditions.
“We can no longer host a small yoga start-up on a Sunday morning at 11 a.m., who found our venue perfect for her yoga class, as these count against our 25 ‘live events’ per year and yoga isn’t at the top of the list for us to utilize the 25,” Lees said. “We can no longer conduct our Brewer’s Hour, which was an hour on a Sunday where customers could pay to receive two beers and hear our brewer talk about the intent behind the beers and provide beer education.
“The conditions do not allow us to sell a ticket that includes beer and an event such as this would also count against our 25,” he continued. “We just don’t have enough live events available.”
The conditions also cap the number of private events breweries can host to 52, which translates to one per week, something that has been particularly limiting for Flounder since the opening of its new space.
“Many people want to host private parties or weddings at [our] beautiful setting, but we can only host 52 private events per year so these conditions even limit the amount of private functions we can use our space for,” Lees said. “Our brewery has become a tourist attraction in our county and brings visitors from hours away and we work together with our local and county tourism boards to work on ways to bring those visitors to other places in the area once they are with us.
“Everything about the special ruling and conditions is counteractive to what craft beer has proven all across the country — a valuable asset to tourism, economic development and positive impacts on all types of local establishments,” he continued.
For a state with more than 9 million residents, New Jersey’s craft beer industry lags behind states of similar size in several metrics tracked by the Brewers Association (BA), the trade group representing the country’s small and independent craft brewers. New Jersey’s 141 craft breweries amount to two breweries per capita (per 100,000 legal-drinking-age adults), ranking 45th nationwide. Last year, those breweries produced 213,656 barrels of beer, about one gallon per LDA adult, ranking 46th nationwide.
The BGNJ, which Wells estimated represents about one-third of the state’s breweries, has called on Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration to “recognize the need for reform in the wake of the pandemic to keep our local beer industry growing.”
“We hope forthcoming regulations issued by NJABC later this year utilize our recommendations for the good of the dozens of small businesses which make up the state’s craft beer industry,” Orlando wrote on behalf of the guild. “While we understand the NJABC is only empowered to enforce the laws as written, our guild believes the imposition of these broad conditions at this juncture by the division is extremely problematic and need[s] to be remedied.”

Bang Energy files motion to vacate fine,"Bang Energy maker Vital Pharmaceuticals’ motion to vacate a $175 million arbitration award was denied last week, clearing the way for Orange Bang and Monster Energy Company to collect damages plus a 5% royalty on all future net sales of Bang-branded products.
The award — in addition to nearly $10 million in attorney’s fees and costs — had been granted in April after family-owned beverage maker Orange Bang and Monster Energy Company successfully argued to an arbitrator that VPX was liable for breach of contract and trademark infringement by falsely claiming its products contain creatine.
The case stems from a 2009 trademark infringement filed by Orange Bang against VPX, which had granted it permission to use the Bang trademark on creatine-based products or other beverages that are marketed exclusively in vitamin and supplement channels.
Speaking at BevNET Live Summer 2022 last month, Bang’s outspoken CEO Jack Owoc dismissed the ruling as “the false ruling of a rogue arbitrator who has no background in science.”
“Never sign a contract that has arbitration, because it’s a circumvention of the legal system,” he said. “Don’t sign it. Go to court. Due process.”
In his June 30 decision confirming the arbitration award, Judge Dale S. Fischer wrote, “The arbitrator in this case appears to have taken great care with both the factual issues and the law.”
“In short, there is no basis to find that the award was ‘completely irrational’ or that the arbitrator engaged in ‘manifest disregard of the law,’” he wrote. “At most, Plaintiffs’ arguments suggest that the arbitrator may have been incorrect in his rulings, but that falls far short of the standard for vacating an arbitration award.”
Owoc did not respond to a request for comment.

New American Whiskey Brands,"Pernod Ricard announced last week the launch of The American Whiskey Collective, a new business unit dedicated to the company’s American whiskey portfolio that will pursue growth by investing in the “new fashioned” brands’ innovation, according to the division’s newly appointed head, Craig Johnson.
“When you look at American whiskey brands, one of the tried and true formulas [for growth] is through innovation,” said Johnson.
While the French company owns powerhouse Irish and Scotch whiskeys like Jameson and Ballentine’s, Pernod Ricard’s state-side focus is on premium, non-traditional challenger brands. Rabbit Hole, acquired in 2019, is known for distinct grain mixes and limited edition releases. Lesser known spirits like Smooth Ambler and TX Whiskeys joined the portfolio in 2016 and 2019, respectively. And since its acquisition of Jefferson’s Bourbon three years ago, growth of the brand has more than doubled, according to Johnson. Part of that success can be attributed to Jefferson’s forward-thinking founder, Trey Zoeller, whose experiments in aging include Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea Rye.

“Our brands are kind of non-traditional American whiskeys and we’re really proud of that,” he said. “The consumers of American whiskeys look to get unique products, whether it’s unique recipes like Rabbit Hole has or unique aging like Jefferson’s Ocean.”
American whiskey sales are expected to account for a significant amount of Pernod Ricard USA’s total volumes within the next five to 10 years. The category has been enjoying a resurgence recently —and different processes, flavors and aging techniques are part of the increased interest, according to Drizly BevAlc Insights. American whiskey volume has been accelerating over the last decade, growing from 16 million nine-liter cases in 2011 to 29.7 million in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.
An interest in local products could also be giving distillers a boost, especially as whiskey production has expanded out from traditional regions. Smooth Ambler is distilled in West Virginia and TX is made near Fort Worth, Texas.
“There is that macro trend of people wanting local products. They want products from the U.S., but they also want craft and high quality products,” said Johnson.
The collective will build on the models of two similar divisions, the Gin Hub and House of Tequila, that boost smaller brands with operations and marketing support.
“The focus and the attention that these new business units can bring to categories can be a real driver of the business and a real strength,” he said.

Expect to see new offerings similar to Rabbit Hole’s limited edition releases and a TX-branded ready-to-drink product that recently launched in Texas. Advertising support will also be a priority: Johnson and the team are considering nontraditional media approaches that have been effective in previous campaigns, such as its 13-minute documentary on Jefferson’s founder. Expect some celebrity presence too— TX recently teamed up with actor Scott McNairy for a series of spots aimed at millennial drinkers and highlighting its roots as a uniquely Texas brand.
Establishing a consolidated global footprint is also a priority, starting with Western Europe and Asia. American whiskey exports have enjoyed growth as of late, with annual sales now exceeding 20 million cases. Pernod Ricard itself saw global sales surge by double digits in the first half of fiscal year 2022, with organic growth up 17%, thanks to the strength of the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan, according to the company’s latest earnings report.

With the opportunity clear, the French spirits conglomerate will support The American Whiskey Collective with the “infrastructure, marketing investment levels and innovation support” that match its “ambitious performance goals.” That will be the task ahead for division leaders Johnson, a member of Pernod Ricard USA’s executive team and an 18-year company veteran, and Jessica Chen, vice president of operations for American whiskies.
“We feel that we can start with global growth because we’re in a place that from an operations standpoint we can help fund global growth behind these brands now, and we’re in a place from a supply chain standpoint that we can deliver,” said Johnson.

Sustainability results in Profits from top Ten Beverage Distribution,"Top-ten beverage distributor engages industry-leading sustainability firm to reduce costs and greenhouse gas emissions throughout its operations.
Double Green, a provider of sustainable solutions that reduce costs and carbon emissions, announced that Crescent Crown Distributing is leveraging Double Green’s expertise to meet its sustainability goals, reduce costs and make the business and its facilities more resilient.
Sustainability is not a new endeavor for Crescent Crown, with operations in Arizona and Louisiana. Since 2012, the beer, spirits, and non-alcoholic beverage distributor has been running its Arizona warehouse operations through its own rooftop solar power system, and added almost 100% more solar capacity through a carport system installed in 2020.
“We’re proud of our results in reducing our environmental impact from our investments over the years. We are committed to being a national leader in everything that we do. By partnering with Double Green, we’ll have a roadmap for continuous sustainable improvement to quantifiably reduce our environmental impact and that of the brands we represent,”  said James R. Moffett, President of Crescent Crown Distributing.
Molly Reilly, President of Double Green, said, “Crescent Crown is known as a sustainable leader in the beer and beverage and logistics industry. We’re thrilled to support their goals of delivering a truly sustainable plan measuring and communicating their financial and environmental savings.”
Neil Baier, Vice President of Finance for Crescent Crown Distributing, said, “We’ve seen the financial value in our Arizona renewable energy investments, and with Double Green’s help, we are certain we will find even greater savings.”
“We’re committed to sustainability and continuous improvement, but we can’t lose our focus on doing what we do best, selling and delivering our supplier’s beverages to retail,” said Baier. “I am therefore really excited to have Double Green do the heavy lifting, evaluating the solutions and quantifying the returns to support our business goals to ensure our facilities have long-term sustainability.”

AB Passes on acquiring craft Brewing Alliance,"The deadline for Anheuser-Busch InBev to make a qualifying offer to acquire the remaining stake of Craft Brew Alliance (CBA) came and went today without an offer.
The world’s largest beer manufacturer, which already owns 31.3 percent of the smaller Portland, Oregon-headquartered craft beer maker, had until today, August 23, to either make an offer for the remaining stake in the company at a minimum of $24.50 per share (about $328 million) or pay a $20 million fee.
Ultimately, A-B decided to pay a one-time $20 million fee to CBA, whose brands include Kona Brewing, Widmer Brothers, Redhook, Omission, Square Mile Cider, Wynwood Brewing, Cisco Brewers and Appalachian Mountain Brewery, as well as the pH Experiment.
In a statement, A-B Brewers Collective president Marcelo “Mika” Michaelis said:
“The long-standing and strong partnership we have with Craft Brew Alliance (CBA) is extremely valuable to Anheuser-Busch. While we are not making an offer to purchase the remaining shares of CBA, our existing commercial partnership with CBA continues to be a key complement to our industry-leading craft portfolio and we look forward to working together for many years to come.”
In a separate statement, Andy Thomas, CEO of CBA, called A-B’s decision “disappointing” but said with the company’s immediate ownership situation now clear, “management can turn its attention to refining strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.”
“Over the past several years, we have built a sustainable infrastructure, optimized our footprint, and amassed a diversified portfolio of brands to support future profitable growth anchored by robust growth in the Kona brand and the addition of our three newly acquired brands,” he said. “Looking to the future, we are optimistic that our healthy balance sheet, bolstered by the $20 million payment, and strategic investments in innovation and increased brand awareness will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more details of our growth plan in the coming weeks.”
Still, more questions remain than answers. Chief among them, why did A-B pass on the opportunity to acquire CBA and its fast-growing Kona Brewing brand, which is on pace to be a 500,000-barrel brand by year end? And, moving forward, what is A-B’s interest in the company?
Due to the size of CBA, such a transaction would have necessitated review and approval by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
The prospect of a qualifying offer had hung over CBA in recent years, and a transaction seemed to make sense as CBA’s route to market is closely aligned with A-B through brewing, distribution and export contracts. However, those deals will remain in place for up to another seven years, at CBA’s election, including a Master Distributor Agreement (MDA) to leverage A-B’s wholesaler network at $0.25 per case through 2028, the ability to contract brew up to 300,000 barrels at A-B’s production facilities at a savings of $10 per barrel; and export opportunities through A-B subsidiaries.
Without the spectre of an A-B offer, CBA is now free to explore other options unencumbered, including a potential sale to another buyer.
Following CBA’s Q2 earnings report earlier this month, Thomas told Brewbound that there are “an infinite number of possibilities” for CBA in the event an A-B never materialized. Nevertheless, A-B will still have a say in any potential deal, holding two seats on CBA’s eight-member board.
CBA now reaps $20 million to use as it sees fit. In a “Quick Take” report today, Cowen managing director for beverages, cannabis and tobacco Vivien Azer suggested CBA could use that windfall to restructure its business, pay down debt, repurchase shares, or invest behind Kona and new innovations in the “beyond beer” space.
A-B passing on an outright acquisition of CBA comes just weeks after the company announced a deal for Cleveland, Ohio-based Platform Beer Co., the company’s first craft acquisition since purchasing North Carolina’s Wicked Weed in 2017.
CBA will hold a conference call on Thursday, September 5, to give an update on its business strategy moving forward, as well as full-year 2019 financial projections.

Breaking Down Beer’s Blowout Fourth,"Off-premise tallies from the lead-up to the Fourth are in, and while the bev alc category failed to top last year’s performance, it was still a blowout week for booze.
The week ending July 3 represented the 5th highest week of bev alc sales ever, raking in just over $1.624 billion, per IRI multi-outlet and convenience data supplied by the firm’s Scott Scanlon.
And of note for you, dear reader, is the fact that the week marked the 3rd highest week of beer sales ever. 
THIRD BIGGEST WEEK OF BEER SALES EVER. Yes, the beer category brought in $1.104 billion in sales over the week, trailing only the two previous Fourth of July holiday weeks, wherein the category notched $1.123 billion over the week in 2021, and $1.153 during the 2020 holiday. (Though keep in mind that this latest week didn’t include the actual day of July 4 in it, while the two others did.)
With beer making up more than $1 billion of the $1.624 billion sold by bev alc over the week, it’s evident that beer is still the go-to alcoholic beverage during the holiday – even if W&S have some unreported sales over the week in untracked channels. Indeed, take a look below…
HIGHLIGHTING BEER’S DOMINANCE OVER THE HOLIDAY. Here are a few data points that highlight beer’s dominance during the week.  
There were nearly seven beer segments that snagged more than $100 million in sales over the week. Meanwhile, wine or spirits didn’t have a single segment that raked in more than $100 million (whiskey is the only W&S segment that came close, at $72 million). 
The biggest beer segment, domestic premium, brought about $279 million in sales during the week. That means the domestic premium segment alone brought in more dollars than total spirits ($253.5 million) or total wine ($266 million) did over the week.
Then imports weren’t too far behind domestic premiums’ sales during the week, bringing in $243 million. So, if you add up just imports’ and domestic premiums’ sales over the week ($522 million), the two beer segments sold more than total wine & spirits combined ($520 million).
Alright, enough size comparison, let’s break down beer’s performance during the week.
A LOOK AT BEER SEGMENT PERFORMANCE. As noted above, the beer category didn’t top last year’s Fourth of July sales — it was down 1.7% — but that’s owed primarily to hard seltzer’s decline vs. last year.
The segment is still a beast — bringing in nearly $124 million in sales during the week, making it the third largest beer segment over the frame — and it had the highest week-over-week increase in sales of any beer segment, up 21.2% vs. the week ending June 26, indicating that a lot of people reached for hard seltzer at the store for the Fourth holiday period.
Still, not nearly as many people put it in their cart this year as they did last year, as the segment dropped 18% vs YA, representing the only beer segment to drop double digits during the week. And that 18% decline is a far cry from its 52-week trend of down only 3%.
Nearly every other beer segment outpaced its 52-week trend in the latest week. The biggest leap came from sub-premiums, up 2% in the latest week, vs. its 52-week trend of -5.6%.
Indeed, sub-premium was one of five beer segments to notch dollar growth over the frame. Here’s the list:
FMBs, up 11.5%
Non-alc beer, up 11.1%
Imports, up 5.2%
Super-premium, up 3.6%
And sub-premium, up 2%
And four beer segments saw declines during the week: domestic premium, down 4%; cider, down 6%; craft, down 6.7%; and of course hard seltzer, down 18%.
PEEKING INTO BRAND PERFORMANCE IN BEER, we see that half of the top ten brand fams snagged dollar growth over the week. Check it out:
Modelo fam (#2 brand family), up 18.6%
Busch (#8), up 9%
Michelob (#3), up 4.4%
Corona (#4), up 2.8%
And Miller Lite (#7), up 0.2%
IRI’s Scott Scanlon called out other strong performances too, like Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which grew 144%, adding that he believes the brand will “maintain” its “hyper growth run likely through summer.” And he also highlighted White Claw too, which despite a 7% drop in dollars over the week, “eclipsed Miller Lite” to become the 6th largest brand fam in beer.
Then too, the Twisted Tea brand fam as well as the New Belgium brand fam, continued their hot streak over the holiday, up 44% and 23.2%, respectively.
AND FINALLY, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE. Four of the top ten beer suppliers saw dollar growth over the week:
Kirin/Lion (the #8 supplier in beer), up 13.1%
Constellation (#3), up 9.3% 
Yuengling (#10), up 8%
And Molson Coors (#2), up 0.1%
A couple suppliers just outside the top ten recorded impressive growth over the week as well, like Geloso Beverage, up 12%; and Phusion Projects, up 8.3%.
Looking at the suppliers that declined in the top ten, we see that Anheuser-Busch (#1), Mark Anthony Brands (#4), Boston Beer (#5), and Diageo Beer Co. (#7) were all down low to mid-singles. Pabst (#9) was down 9.5%, and Heineken USA (#6) was down 12.8%.
PEPSI CHIEF ON BEV ALC: WORKING ON  “MULTIPLE NEW INNOVATIONS THAT WILL COME TO MARKET SHORTLY” 
On yesterday’s Pepsi earnings call (which saw good results, logging global net revenue growth of  5.2% in Q2 and 7% YTD), Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta fielded some questions on their bev alc operations. And while he said “nothing’s changed” from his prior quarter remarks on the subject, it seems that the Blue Cloud test balloon –and Pepsi’s entry into the bev alc space – has performed well enough in the company’s eyes to look at new brand opportunities in the very near future. 
Asked about an “update” to the company’s business venture with Boston Beer and Hard Mountain Dew (which you may remember Boston chief Dave Burwick hailed in last earnings call as snagging 27 share of FMB in some of its original launch markets, like Tennessee, Iowa and Florida), chief Ramon said they’ve “learned more” and are “probably more convinced of the potential” for the Boston Beer Partnership. 
“I think we have a great product that they have developed,” he said. Recall, Boston is responsible for producing the product. 
He continued: “We’ve licensed the brand to Boston Beer and we’re providing distribution in some states. Execution is very good. The product is starting very well with high share in those states [including launch areas of Tennessee, Iowa and Florida, and more recently, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Minnesota]. So, it makes us feel positive about the potential of Hard Mountain Dew and the relationship with Boston Beer. They are great partners and they have strong R&D capabilities and branding capabilities as they own the Hard Mountain Dew brand.”
EXPECT “MULTIPLE NEW INNOVATIONS” IN ALCOHOL FROM PEPSI. “Now, going forward, obviously we get encouraged by this and we’re working on multiple new innovations that will come to the market shortly,” he said. 
AS FOR DISTRIBUTION: JUST A “FEW, LARGE” OPPORTUNITIES. “And from the distribution point of view, the same as I said with energy, we want to leverage our assets for distribution. We think in alcohol we can bring new brands to the market.” 
Interestingly, he also noted that they don’t care to distribute “a lot” of brands.
“That’s not our intention, to have many, many brands and a very complex set of brands in our distribution. We’d rather focus on a few large consumer opportunities and put them through what is a very powerful DSD system. So, that is the way we’re thinking about our alcohol distribution. Not a lot of brands; not distributing beer or anything like that, but just a few, large consumer ideas that we can bring to the market through our system, which we think is an advantage … execution machine — and that’s what we’re proving with Hard Mountain Dew.”

Molson Coors Returns to Super Bowl Broadcast for First Time in More than 30 Years,"Today, Molson Coors is announcing that it will return to advertising on the national Super Bowl platform for the first time in more than 30 years. 
It comes on the heels of last month’s announcement that Anheuser-Busch is ending its agreement as the exclusive alcohol advertiser for the Super Bowl, a deal A-B had held since 1989, effectively allowing other bev alc brands to advertise during The Big Game [see BBD 06-17-2022]. 
Molson Coors is the first major supplier to announce plans to advertise during the game since A-B’s announcement.
The company confirmed to BBD that it will have one, 30-second spot. More to come on what that will be in the months ahead.
The Super Bowl is slated to be played on February 12 in Glendale, Arizona, and broadcast nationally on FOX. Per Molson Coors numbers, the Big Game historically sees “some 100 million Americans tuning in.”
“This news comes at a time when Molson Coors is outperforming nearly every other major brewer in terms of industry-share gains,” the company announced. Indeed, Molson Coors is the second-largest dollar share gainer in the latest four weeks of NielsenIQ scans to July 2, up 0.4 points. And it is the largest share gainer by far in the food channel during the latest four weeks, up 1.3 points, as well as the largest share gainer YTD in the channel, up 0.5 points.
“While iconic brands like Coors Light and Miller Lite are seeing their strongest performance of the past five years, the company’s newer brands, which include Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Simply Spiked Lemonade, have established Molson Coors as this year’s #1 dollar share gainer in the flavored-alcohol space,” the company said.
The company noted that, despite A-B’s longstanding lock on the national broadcast, brands like Coors Light and Miller Lite have employed “creative marketing strategies to gain share of voice as non-official Super Bowl advertisers.” Last year, Miller Lite opened a watershed “Metaverse bar” surrounding the Game. The year before, it challenged consumers “to manually type the world’s longest browser URL.” 
“While Molson Coors will rejoin the ranks of official Super Bowl advertisers in 2023, the company has several ongoing partnerships with pro-fooball teams and some of the league’s top players,” the company said. Speaking of…
PATRICK MAHOMES SNEAKILY ENDORSES “THE COORS LIGHT” IN NEW DIGITAL ADS
Active NFL players can’t endorse beer brands outright, per league rules. But Molson Coors and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes have found a clever way for the star to advertise the brand, anyway. 
In this new digital spot, Mahomes, a known fan of Coors Light, totes a “12 or 16 fluid ounce” flashlight — dubbed The Coors Light — as a voiceover makes a bunch of allusions to, but never shows, the actual beer. 
It will run on Youtube, Instagram, Twitter “and other digital channels,” per AdAge.
Indeed, Molson Coors tells BBD that the ad won’t be airing on TV. “We chose to air this digitally, and specifically on social media, where Patrick’s fans are incredibly engaged with everything he is doing,” they said. 
Mischief (the agency also responsible for those recent Coke/MC Simply Spiked commercials) created the commercial. 
“It’s a flashlight, not a beer,” the spot says.
“The Coors Light is 100% flashlight, and 0% adult beverage,” though it is also “perfect for camping trips, or those warm summer nights spent with great friends.” 
The light is even “made with high-quality steel, so it feels as cold as the Rocky Mountains.”
Coors Light also takes a page from Miller Lite’s “viral merch” playbook here (which has debuted both the “Shoezie” shoe koozie and holiday-time Beernaments): AdAge reveals that the company will sell mini versions of the Coors Light flashlight online for the next few days, with proceeds going to Mahomes’ charitable foundation, 15 and the Mahomies.
GROKKING THE RISKS IN SPIKING NON-ALC BRANDS 
We are sailing through new and uncharted waters.  Since hard seltzers and their ilk have taken off, never have we seen so many popular non-alc brands charge boldly into the highly regulated bev-alc space with line extensions. But there are risks. 
As we’ve mentioned several times here, in the past it wasn’t the federal government (FDA, TTB, FTC) or even the alcohol regulators at the state level (ABCs or control jurisdictions) who leveled accusations at alcohol marketers of violating public health and putting youth at risk. No, it’s usually the state Attorneys General who get the ball rolling on such matters (see A-B’s Spykes and Phusion Project’s Four Loko as examples). The first time a confused housewife buys a Simply Spiked or Hard Mtn Dew for her kids and it ends up on evening news, this will be a problem. 
The secondary risk, which is a federal issue, is the ban on slotting fees or ‘pay to play’ for alcohol beverages. Non-alc marketers are used to this practice — along with creative discounting and consumer rebates and prizes — which are illegal in most areas for bev-alc. And yet where does the slotting fee Coke pays for regular Fresca end, and Fresca Mixed start? 
These questions are philosophical and hypothetical at this point, until they aren’t. The question is how would each non-alc company – given its bev-alc strategy – fare during such a possible existential crisis? Here are the main players. 
Pepsi’s Hard MTN Dew (with Boston Beer Co.)
Coke’s Jack n Coke (with Brown-Forman)
Coke’s Simply Spiked (with Molson Coors)
Coke’s Topo Chico Hard Seltzer (with Molson Coors)
Coke’s Fresca Mixed (with Constellation)
Sonic Hard Seltzer (with Coop Aleworks)
Vita Coco Spiked (with Diageo’s Captain Morgan)
AriZona Sun Rise (with Heineken USA)
PEPSICO.  Pepsi’s arrangement is interesting for two reasons: First is they are licensing the Mtn Dew marque to Boston Beer, so legally Boston Beer ‘owns’ the brand while Pepsi’s Blue Cloud division distributes it DSD-style.  So if the AGs or FDA demand that Hard Mtn Dew be pulled from the shelves (a la Four Loko), it will presumably be Pepsi’s responsibility to buy back the product, and Boston Beer’s responsibility to pay any fines.  That could prove expensive for one brand. 
COKE. For its part, Coke has more bev-alc brands out there, but they have taken a different route, partnering with bev-alc companies for production and distribution, but spreading the love over several players (Molson Coors, Constellation, and Brown-Forman).  
RISKY? But regardless of the structure, putting a well-known non-alc brand marque on a product which contains alcohol pushes the historical boundaries of propriety politically in this country — at least historically — and thereby has inherent risks. 
BOTTOM LINE:   Monster is probably making the smart move in keeping their brand marque off the label of their bev-alc product.  
ABL VOICES ITS CONCERN TO TREASURY DEPT. OVER COMPETITION REPORT
The American Beverage Licensees (ABL), which represents thousands of bars, taverns, restaurants and package stores, penned a letter to Department of the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen late last month expressing concerns over the “Competition in the Markets for Beer, Wine and Spirits” report released earlier this year. 
“While we support President Biden’s goals to improve competition in the American economy, we believe that some of the report’s suggestions are misguided and do not take into account the competitive and vibrant beverage alcohol culture and marketplaces in all 50 states,” executive director of the trade association, John Bodnovich, writes.
The ABL primarily touched on concerns about how shifting federal regulations through the TTB may impact a “well-functioning and competitive industry that plays an important role in local communities across the country.”
For one, John wrote, the report does not “justify modifying long-standing and effective regulation” that is currently in place. He added that implementing new rules may potentially hurt American workers as well as its member businesses as negative impacts from the pandemic, high inflation, supply chain issues and workforce challenges continue.
The ABL was also “disappointed” that the report “weigh[ed] some comments quite favorably while largely disregarding others without good reason,” later noting how the report didn’t consider how emerging suppliers have gained “greater access to markets and consumers than they’ve ever had– often at the expense of industry partners (who are now also competitors),” per letter. It goes on to note that smaller players can “just as easily… manipulate the marketplace as other players.”
“We do not believe the report has presented a compelling reason to overhaul the Constitutionally-legitimate regulatory balance of a highly competitive and successful segment of the American economy,” continued John. “The alcohol industry has proven itself to be a model for competitiveness in the American economy, thanks in part to the existing robust state and federal regulatory structure.”
“As TTB considers the Treasury Department’s report we ask that you decline from proposing any regulations that would undoubtedly create more uncertainty and difficulty for hardworking Americans and their families,” the letter closed. 
BREWPIC: “Game On,” Molson Coors says about being able to advertise in Super Bowl LVII."
Constellation Launching Victoria’s First U.S. Innovation: Vicky Chamoy,"Constellation is set to launch Victoria’s first innovation in the U.S. this fall: Vicky Chamoy.

The brand, which seeks to appeal primarily to Victoria’s core un-acculturated Hispanic consumer, will hit in 24 oz. cans, starting this September. It is slated to go national. 

Based on sell sheets and other intel we’ve seen (from our infamous nefarious back channels), the 3.5% ABV product will be line priced with other CBI 24 oz. cans (like Modelo Chelada).

It’s a timely launch, as RTD cheladas continue to grow, “posting +15% 2-YR CAGR,” per company sales materials.

This is an “authentic” Mexican drink that pairs Victoria’s cred with trendy-yet-traditional Chamoy. It’s a popular flavor and candy in Mexico as well as South Texas, where you’ll see Chamoy sticks and rims on cocktails at hipster bars, but also sold in small packs at gas stations and grocery stores alike.  

Indeed, the product has already launched in Mexico, where Victoria is the no. 3 beer brand –and that brand love “extends here in the U.S.” among Mexican Americans, according to Constellation’s Vicky Chamoy sell sheet. The company believes the offering will help them capitalize on incremental drinking occasions and target additional consumers, too. 

“Reasons to believe” in the brand include the fact that single-serve is Hispanic consumers’ pack of choice (they’re at a 20% overindex for that format). Then, too, Hispanic drinkers overindex in “flavored beer” consumption. 

Their media plan underscores their core unacculturated consumer: Vicky Chamoy will get “‘360 Degree Marketing Support’ to drive awareness and trial for the new product in Spanish-language only” formats. Target accounts include convenience, liquor, grocery, mass channels and independent, Hispanic accounts. Stay tuned.

SIMPLY SPIKED, ALREADY HAVING REACHED TOP FMB STATUS IN CERTAIN RETAILERS, LAUNCHES MEDIA CAMPAIGN 


We’ve been sharing details around the fast start for Simply Spiked Lemonade, the hard juice RTD hatched by Molson Coors and Coke. 

A month ago, we reported retailers’ early success with the brand [see BBD 06-14-2022]; and just last week, some wholesalers mentioned it as a contributor to July 4 sales. 

Now Molson Coors is investing against a 360 campaign for the brand, commemorating the base juice brand’s “21st birthday.” And yes, that includes TV commercials. You can check out the 15-second spot here, created by lead agency of record, Mischief (which kicked off its work with Molson Coors last summer via that MGD “seltzer launch” stunt [see BBD 05-11-2021]). 

The campaign will be national; Molson Coors tells BBD it will appear during the premieres for The Bachelorette and Better Call Saul, as well as the ESPYs. 

“Our new campaign is rooted in a simple insight– Simply turned 21 and is all grown up. So, we couldn’t pick a better time to launch our first campaign for Simply Spiked Lemonade,” said Joy Ghosh, vice president of above premium beer and flavored alcohol beverages at Molson Coors Beverage Company.

They’re investing behind TVC because of the brand’s promising start. Indeed, says Molson Coors, Simply Spiked Lemonade is the “most talked about Molson Coors innovation launch in the past five years,” having been mentioned on Twitter “5 times more over the past six months than the most talked about hard seltzer” and “most searched hard lemonade on Google” since its debut in June. 

The company says that Simply Spiked has already sold more than 6 million cans since its launch just about five weeks back. That was enough to land the brand at 3.6 dollar share of FMBs in the latest week of IRI multi-outlet and convenience data. 

Simply spiked is also “the #1 flavored malt beverage at some of the major grocery retailers across the US,” Molson Coors says. Albertson’s and Kroger are showing it as a top FMB, the company shared with BBD. 

ON-PREMISE VELOCITY BENEFITS FROM FATHER’S DAY BOOST, PER CGA

CGA hinted back in mid-June that Father’s Day this year (June 19) should bring a “welcome boost of sales” to the on-premise, and indeed it did.

On-premise value velocity was up 6% for the week ending June 25 compared to the previous week, driven by an increase in ticket count (+4%) and check value (+2%), per latest CGA data.

Then too, all five key states tracked by CGA saw increases in velocity vs. the prior week. New York (+11%) and Florida (+8%) experienced the largest growth week over week, while Texas posted 6% growth, and Illinois and California each notched 3% growth.

Looking at the latest week’s trends compared to the same week last year, CGA reported total U.S. velocity up 7%, and three of the five key states seeing growth.

New York, once again, led the way in the latest report, with velocity 22% higher than last year. Illinois also saw double digit growth year-over-year, up 11%. And California followed up 7%. Texas and Florida, meanwhile, both saw declines, down 3% and 4%, respectively.

BUT ON-PREMISE TRENDS TAKE A FEW STEPS BACK IN LATEST BEERBOARD

While the channel was looking healthy heading into July, per story above, BeerBoard’s latest on-premise status report shows a few sobering trends for bars and restaurants, as volumes, rate of sale and percentage of taps pouring have dipped for the last few periods. 

The latest data tracked trends from the weekend of July 7-10 vs. prior periods (their last reports were May 5-8 and April 21-24). 

Most concerningly, volume was down for the fourth consecutive period in this latest set, down 11% vs. the weekend of May 5-8 (and down 3.8% vs. the same weekend in 2021). In fact, each of the 11 states that BeerBoard tracks were down for the weekend, “including six in double digits,” while New York (-20%), Michigan (-16.8%) and Minnesota (-16.1%) “saw significant declines for the period.”

Rate of sale sagged as well, having declined “three of the previous four periods tracked,” per report. Rate of Sale checked in at 2.45 for the July 7 weekend, down -10.9% from May 5-8 (and 18.6% vs. prior year). 

Finally, percentage of Taps Pouring fell for the fourth consecutive period, dropping back two points to 70%. 

We asked the guys at BeerBoard why the last few periods have seen setbacks for their on-premise set. 

“When looking back at Volume and ROS for 2019, current levels are more closely mirroring that period,” a company spokesperson told BBD. “ROS exploded over the past few years due to retailers carrying less handles on average. After a strong period of growth post-Covid, coupled with summer travel, it looks like numbers are trending back to their 2019 levels.”"
"Mexican Imports Slowed in May, But still Impressive","Beer imports were down by 0.6% in May, to 3,520,391 barrels. That puts the YTD trend at up 6.1%, per Beer Institute’s Danelle Kosmal. 

Interesting dynamics influenced that number. For one, Mexican imports slowed sequentially, to just 5.5% growth (notably, +4.2% vs. May ’19), down from +15.7% YTD and +10.6% in April.  

But fear not, this is likely just about the flow, and fullness, of inventory (recall, Constellation Beer shipped a lot of beer in its recent quarter ended May 31, with shipments up 17%). 

Danelle shared some crucial STR trends with BBD. Overall, “sales to retailer volume for imports for April 2022 was essentially flat (+0.4%),” said Danelle.  The slow movement of inventory in April led to the slowdown in growth for shipments in May. But thankfully, the glut should dissipate, as STRs for imports picked back up in May (+9.5%), “so we most likely will see Mexican import shipments pick back up again in the June data.”  

And last but not least, Mexican imports faced a very tough comp — up 94% last May. 

Mexican beers were still May imports’ strongest driver, comprising 69% of total import growth. 

Dutch imports were the second biggest growth contributor, up 9.4% for the month. And Italian imports were up 33.7%.

Meanwhile, “imported beer from Belgium, Poland, and Canada were the largest contributors to declines in volume for May,” said Danelle, as those countries experienced high double-digit dips for the month. 

But the Belgian numbers — down roughly 85% — are “due to the shift in production of Stella to the U.S. by Anheuser-Busch.”

BEHIND THE STRATEGIES THAT INFLATION-LAIN CONSUMERS ARE USING AT THE PUMP AND THE BEER SHOP

In part two of our chat with IRI pricing specialist Lance Goodridge, he shares some strategies that the average household is utilizing at the gas pump — and the beer aisle. 

We asked Lance if he’s seeing consumers turn more to large beer packs to save money — or more single-serve type packaging?

It’s a bit of a bifurcation, he says.

SINGLE SERVE AND LARGE PACKS ARE SOLUTIONS FOR LOWER AND HIGHER INCOME SHOPPERS, RESPECTIVELY.   “It really depends on income segment. We’ve seen folks who are struggling on the lower income scale, they’re looking to manage overall baskets. So what happened is, with all the gas prices going crazy, folks are no longer filling their tank. They’re filling to a dollar amount. So they have the ability to manage a budget in a store.

So they’re very conscious of, ‘if I’ve got a hundred dollars to spend, I have to divide that up across the products I need to buy and provide for my family.’ So what we’re seeing in the low-income segments are, they’re looking for lower cost outlays, even at the expense of a per volume basis. So if I can get something for $2, two or three times a week, that’s still better for me than if I’m buying something for $10, which might last me a little bit longer, might be a better price, volume relationship.

“The higher-income folks are still looking for those deals. So their behavior is changing, too. They’re not premiumizing like they were before, but they are looking for bigger, better value deals and they’ve got more dollars to spend to afford those. So it’s kind of both; it’s, you know, the singles and the smaller purchase requirements are fitting the low-end and the larger, price-per-volume plays are fitting the more affluent consumers.”

Asked if it’s bad to be caught in the middle of those pack sizes, Lance says companies should assess just how important the low income segment is to their business. 

But just how squeezed is the “average household” of roughly $60k a year? 

“The inflation, as it stands today, is costing that average household more than $400 per month — just in price increase, no additional stuff; just in price increase,” he emphasized. “So that’s hard to afford. So it’s gonna hit that low-income segment harder than it is relatively on a relative basis than the other segments. So I’d wanna assess how important that segment is to my business and my growth and see if it’s a risk for me or not.”

BUT WHY NO RETURN TO ECONOMY BRANDS? Considering that extra $400 to the average household, why haven’t we seen a bigger return to economy brands?

“I think it’s coming,” says Lance. “I think people are eroding savings that they built up over the last 18 months. Savings were at an all-time high as we hit the end of 21 and credit card debt was at an all time low. Now those have flipped, we’ve eroded savings. Our credit card debt has gone up. The cost of money has gone up through the fed interest rates. So mortgages and car loans and all the things that we took out last year when we have that extra money, they’re costing us more now, defaults are way up. So I think you’re seeing an erosion of available disposable income, and you’re gonna see a much faster switch to that value segment.” 

TEXAS DISTRIBUTORS COMBINE TO FORM THIRD-LARGEST OPERATION IN STATE

There’s still room for wine and spirits wholesalers to combine, apparently. 

In late June, Dallas-based Green Light Distributing and Houston-based United Wine & Spirits merged to create the third-largest spirits distributor in Texas, sister publication Wine & Spirits Daily reported last week. 

The combined company will operate under the Green Light name and primarily focuses on small and mid-sized wine and spirits brands, per announcement. (It currently carries brands like Deep Ellum Spirits, Greenbar Distillery [including the RTDs] and Adictivo Tequila, to name a few.) 

Green Light has experienced “rapid growth” across Texas in the last 18 months and is set to expand into Florida by the end of 2022. Its portfolio includes more than 350 suppliers and currently operates out of five warehouses across Texas. 

With the merger, United Wine & Spirits founder and CEO John Saladino transitioned into the role of partner at Green Light Distribution, where he oversees strategic operations and is involved in community outreach. Green Light’s executive team also includes Matt Nunley, chief revenue officer, managing the company’s financial goals and strategies. In addition, Joe Saladino is joining as director of marketing after leading marketing at United Wine & Spirits. 

“This merger was a no-brainer,” said Green Light founder and CEO, Dusty Odell. “Not only does it give us more robust marketplace coverage, but our goals and values are perfectly aligned in terms of offering best-in-class service and wanting to change the status quo to help small and mid-size brands compete with more muscle.”"
A Pro Groks Beer Price,"The beer industry could certainly use some pricing expertise. 

In a moment where consumers are going from having excess stimulus cash to seeing reserves dry as inflation towers, every CPG entity seems to have its own strategy. 

We’ve seen both sides of the spectrum in beer, with A-B taking price up twice this year (it will likely be upward of 5% in October [see BBD 05-17-2022]) and Constellation saying it’s holding on to its 1%-2% price hike guidance. Meanwhile, distribs and retailers are passing along rising input costs. 

But for a 30,000-foot view of pricing levers and context, BBD turned to IRI’s Lance Goodrige, Executive, Global Analytics and Consulting, who recently authored the very timely report, “Managing Price During Turbulent Times.” 

We wondered what lessons it has for beer.  

Overall, answered Lance: “there’s been less pricing being taken in beer than we’ve seen for other categories across the store.” For total food and beverage, “you’re probably looking at somewhere north of 8% that’s been taken” over the last 6-9 months. 

“Whereas beer is [about] below four. So there’s quite a bit of difference in how other folks have been taking price in store, versus where this industry has been.”

“A REAL SOFTENING OF OVERALL SENSITIVITY TO PRICE CHANGES” AT THE END OF ’21. So how did we get here? And how much price can beer take before sacrificing volume? 

It’s tough, Lance says, because of course “a couple rounds” of stimulus money coming out of COVID gave folks money but not many places (restaurants) to spend it. 

“So there was quite a bit of premiumization in terms of how they were purchasing products, especially CPG-type products. And they were starting to upscale and they’re starting to spend more. And then once inflation and supply chain and things like that started to creep into the system, prices started to edge up, but there really was no impact to demand. So a lot of manufacturers, especially on the food side said, ‘wait a second. You know, my costs are going up dramatically. I need to pass those along.’ Those started to pass through and still no impact to demand. So we saw a real softening of overall sensitivity to price changes back at the end of 21.”

BUT NOW FOLKS ARE “STARTING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY” AND “MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES” But by now, we’ve seen sustained inflation. “I think we’re still lapping pretty big numbers from last year and it’s still in the 8% range. I think June is about the time when it started last year. So, as we continue to lap pretty big numbers, folks are starting to run outta money. So they’re starting to make different choices and we’re starting to see a return to that sensitivity across the store that we hadn’t seen for the last, you know, basically 24 months.”

But does beer still have room to edge up toward that outpacing food pricing without the consumer pushing back?

“I think it does,” Lance said. “It’s a fairly recession-proof category. … Now, there’ll be some trading, you know: different pack sizes, different segments … and channels for instance will change. But overall consumption remains pretty strong through these stressful times. So I’m actually surprised that prices haven’t gone up a bit more than they have so far.”

ROOM TO TAKE PRICE (JUST) THIS YEAR. “I do think there’s room — we’re running outta room — but I do think that there’s room this year, to make some of those price changes or at least pass through some of the price changes that we’re talking about. Getting into next year, it’s a different ball game.”

We wondered if perhaps beer hasn’t gone up more because vodka hasn’t, when it can sometimes be cheaper to make and produce. 

“I don’t see that,” said Lance. “Especially given what’s happening in Ukraine and, and the restriction of some of the corn and wheat and, and raw materials from there. Gas prices, transportation costs have gone up. … So I don’t know that it’s just the cost to produce. You have still have to get it to shelf.” 

However, “we have seen some movement across different manufacturers and vendors,” who have been penalized, he said, pointing to Heineken.

A TALE OF TWO PRICE HIKES.  “So when the Heineken CFO came out, I think it was January or February and said, ‘we have to take a dramatic price increase.’ I think they used the word ‘courageous’. …

“And he tried to get it all back at once, and that didn’t work well for him. Heineken’s been depressed probably ever since that time. And then you contrast that to someone like Constellation, where Modelo and Corona have taken smaller increases over time, but really supported with media and messaging and packaging and innovation, which really softens kind of the blow of those price increases and gives consumers a reason to stick with the brand, versus just this abrupt change in price. …”

But is Constellation Beer leaving money on the table, taking such a little increase vs. competitors (and didn’t we just talk about beer being able to take more price this year)?

“I don’t think so,” said Lance, “because both their dollars and their volume have continued to rise. And, you know, typically when you take price, what you wanna do is you wanna minimize the volume loss, but gain dollars. And they’ve been able to continue to do both.

“CAUTIOUS IS BETTER”FOR STZ BEER. “Is there money left on the table? Yeah, there probably is some money left on the table, but they’re being very cautious about edging their way into covering their costs. I don’t know what their costs are. I don’t know what their position is, relative to other manufacturers. I would guess that it’s pretty strong given their global footprint. I do think there’s room. I don’t know how much room that is, but cautious is better, I think, for them, especially in this competitive environment.”

WHAT ABOUT PROMOTION ACTION? AVOIDING $5 FOOTLONG SYNDROME.  We also asked: Especially in the wake of summer promo season, does Lance have any tips for how and when brewers can discount and promote without running into the ‘$5 footlong’ phenomenon? (Where of course Subway found it hard to take price after such a successful promo.) 

Lance noted that COVID — 2020 and the first half of ’21 — was marked by a lack of promotion. 

“So basically in the absence of promotion, we allowed those prices to float. And they went north a little bit. I think promotions overall across the store were down about 25%, which is a pretty big deal.

“But I think now, when folks are realizing that volume is impacted by some of these price increases, they’re gonna have to come back with a promotion strategy that makes sense for their brand. We have to give consumers a reason to stay with our brand and stay with the outlet in which they’re buying our brand.” That involves not only marketing, but also savvy promotion. 

But that’s not without warning. 

“My fear and caution about promotion is that everyone’s gonna be buying for the same space in the second half of the year. So getting with your retail partners and making sure that you’ve got your objective locked in is gonna be extremely important— because CSDs are coming for that space. Water’s coming for that space; seltzer’s coming for that space. Uh, even, you know, non-beverage categories are gonna be looking for that space as well. So I think the competition is gonna heat up for that because everybody’s gonna be looking to preserve volume in the second half.”

More Monday on how shoppers are cherry picking pack sizes in this environment, and when we can see economy brands start to pop. Inflation could certainly switch up this recession-resistant category: Lance points out that the average household (at $60,000 income) is now spending an extra $400-plus monthly, just on price increases alone.

BIOSTEEL NOW THE “OFFICIAL HYDRATION PARTNER” OF THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE

Last week, new BioSteel chief/Constellation alum Bruce Jacobson told BBD that the world would soon see outsized investment for the burgeoning hydration company [see BBD 07-01-2022].

That’s crucial context behind the company’s new announcement that BioSteel has just announced a “multi-year partnership” naming BioSteel the Official Hydration Partner of the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players’ Association. It fits the brand’s DNA, as Biosteel’s Michael Cammalleri was an NHL player (and his business partner John Celenza was a former NHLPA intern). 

This marks the sports hydration company’s first partnership with a league. The deal will debut during the 2022 NHL Draft in Montreal, where BioSteel is a presenting sponsor of national coverage across Rogers Sportsnet in Canada. 

“The new partnership will provide the BioSteel brand with League-wide rinkside marketing and product supply rights, retail activation rights, community engagement platforms, player marketing and activation rights and more,” per announcement.

There’s lots to it: “Beginning in the 2022-23 NHL regular season, fans will see NHL players hydrating with BioSteel during every NHL game in North America. BioSteel products will be featured on each bench, penalty box and goal net. In addition, BioSteel will have a year-round platform to activate brand programming with NHL marks, logos, teams and players, including at the NHL Scouting Combine and NHL Draft, which includes a new BioSteel-sponsored Prospects Portal on NHL.com.” 

BioSteel will also be a presenting partner of a marquee NHL social platform “to be announced at a later date.”  

BANG CAN’T ESCAPE $175M ARBITRATION AWARD TO MONSTER AND ORANGE BANG

Welp, it appears Bang Energy’s parent company, Vital Pharmaceuticals (VPX), is officially on the losing end of one of “the largest trademark infringement awards in U.S. history,” per Reuters.

Indeed, a California federal court ruled last week that VPX cannot escape the massive $175 million trademark win awarded in arbitration to Monster and small orange juice maker, Orange Bang, earlier this year.

On top of the $175 million, VPX is on the hook to pay out a 5% royalty fee on Bang-branded sales moving forward, as well as nearly $10 million in attorney fees. Ouch.

How did we get here? Well, Reuters reports that way back in 2009, Orange Bang sued VPX claiming the company’s “Bang-branded pre-workout drinks would cause confusion.” Orange Bang and VPX eventually settled in 2010, “allowing [VPX] to continue using the Bang name on ‘creatine-based’ drinks, as well as other drinks if sold only through fitness-focused venues like gyms and vitamin shops.”

But when VPX rolled its Bang Energy RTD in 2015, a pre-workout energy drink that was billed to contain “Super Creatine,” Orange Bang linked up with Monster “to accuse [VPX] of breaking the settlement and violating Orange Bang’s trademark rights, arguing the drinks are not creatine-based.” Law 360 notes that Monster and Orange Bang reportedly came to an agreement “that let Monster litigate the case in exchange for half of any recovery.”

VPX then filed suit in 2020, “alleging Monster had wrongly ‘weaponized’ the settlement and requested a ruling that it did not infringe,” according to Reuters.

The case was eventually sent to arbitration, where a California arbitrator ruled in favor of Monster and Orange Bang, having found that “Bang Energy’s drink is not creatine-based because ‘Super Creatine’ is not actually creatine and does not raise the body’s creatine levels,” per Reuters.

The arbitrator handed out the hefty $175 million award to Monster and Orange Bang, as well as the 5% royalty fee, and Bang fought the ruling claiming the arbitrator “effectively dispensed his own brand of economic justice.”

That brings us to this latest update from the California federal court, where U.S. District Judge Dale S. Fischer ruled that “whether correct or incorrect,” the arbitrator’s opinion “grapples in good faith with the various conflicts in the case,” and ultimately upheld the decision.

BEER BRIEFS:

BILL TO EXPAND RTD COCKTAIL AVAILABILITY FALLS FLAT IN NORTH CAROLINA. The Beer Institute put out notice yesterday that the North Carolina Legislature has chosen not to advance House Bill 904 this legislative session. The BI commended NC lawmakers “for protecting local jobs and opposing tax breaks for out-of-state liquor companies,” though the bill appears to be more of an expanded availability effort for canned cocktails than a tax equivalency push. Still, the BI calls it another win for America’s beer businesses, noting that “tax carveout proposals for big liquor in numerous states—including Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Washington and West Virginia— either stalled or failed during this year’s legislative sessions.”

D-MAC IS BACK, AS CHIEF OF SALES AT JIANT. Longtime beer vet, Dave Macon, who stepped down from his post as Firestone Walker’s sales chief earlier this year, has landed a new gig as chief sales officer at Jiant, a fast-growing “modern alcohol brand” out of Southern California that currently produces both hard kombucha and hard tea lines. Check out the full story on the big hire for Jiant in CBD later today.

A-B Selling Oakland ONE Operation to Markstein Sales Co. and Matagrano Inc.,"Today, Anheuser-Busch is announcing the sale of its AB ONE Oakland, California operation to indy A-B wholesalers Markstein Sales Company and Matagrano, Inc., effective July 29. 

Following the close, A-B’s Bay Area distribution will be split: “Markstein Sales Company will integrate the Oakland territory into its existing Antioch-based operations, while Matagrano will incorporate A-B owned distribution operations into their operations in Northern Santa Clara County/San Jose,” per company. Both will “continue to operate out entirely of their current facilities.” 


The move will no doubt strengthen the Bay Area’s indy red network, which suffers from terminally low share, and Markstein and Matagrano could use the scale. Both wholesalers have lost key brands to Reyes in the last couple of years. 

Recall, Constellation terminated its longtime California wholesaler, Markstein Sales Co., in January, for Reyes [see BBD 01-19-2022]. 

Meanwhile, San Fran/Bay area wholesaler Matagrano has also lost key brands like Sierra Nevada and Diageo to Reyes over the last couple of years. 

LAURA AND MATT SPEAK. “As a woman-owned, family-owned business with 102 years of local experience, we are proud of our long-term partnership with Anheuser-Busch as they continually demonstrate a willingness to support and work with their independent wholesalers as true partners,” Markstein chief Laura Markstein commented on the deal. “We appreciate the opportunity to integrate Anheuser-Busch’s Oakland territory and members of its workforce into our operations and to continue bringing Anheuser-Busch’s leading portfolio of brands to our retail customers in this large and diverse community we call home.”

Matt Matagrano, president of Matagrano Inc., said they also “value [their] long-standing partnership with Anheuser-Busch, and we will continue to fuel our collective growth by providing the highest quality products and highest level of service to our retail customers in the Bay Area.

“Matagrano is committed to the future success of the portfolio, and we look forward to welcoming members of the Anheuser-Busch team over

the coming weeks.”

A-B’S TAKE. The brewer said the announcement is part of A-B’s

ongoing efforts to ensure “the strongest possible route-to-market” and the “highest level of service” across all markets. 

“The strength of our wholesaler system is a critical element as we drive to deliver industry innovation and growth, and that includes both our industry-leading independent wholesaler network as well as our

Anheuser-Busch facilities,” said Kyle Norrington, U.S. Chief Commercial Officer.

Will A-B look to acquire another wholesaler operation elsewhere? Recall, A-B chief Brendan Whitworth told our Beer Summit earlier this year that A-B owned distributors are about 7% of their total volumes right now (you may recall, they’re capped at around 10%). So they have some breathing room.

"
Your Super Early July 4 Read: Much Better Than Memorial Day,"If our early conversations with wholesalers from around the country are any indicator, the Fourth seemed to be better than Memorial Day’s ho-hum showing for beer sales. 

We asked more than 50 distributors how their July 4 sales were trending. The early replies are pretty promising (though some are still seeing inflationary pressures affecting sales). 

The very top level summary goes like this: Seltzers are down double digits, but premium lights actually fared pretty well (especially for MC). Some economy brands (Busch Light, Keystone Light) are pulling. Non-alc is making a difference in a good way. And the usual suspects are saving the day in some cases: STZ Beer, Mich Ultra, Twisted Tea. We’re even hearing great things about Simply, the Molson Coors/Coke hard juice play. Full-cal trends led one wholesaler to remark: “Sugar is back?” 

But look out for chains using beer as a loss leader. 

Let’s dig into a few themes. 

GROWTH FOR THE FOWTH. The vast majority of our wholesalers said July 4 trends were good — better than Memorial Day, though apparently we’re still dealing with some residual out of stocks. Here’s a sample from some sizable wholesalers around the country:

“We had fantastic weather and sales were great- 3rd biggest week (volume) in company history- way better than Memorial Day.”

But even without great weather, another wholesaler says:  “July 4th was much stronger than Memorial Day for sales across the register.  Roughly flat to last year’s July 4th holiday while Memorial Day 22 was significantly off Memorial Day 21. Monday (July 4th) was the best day for scans across the register despite rainy and cold weather in our region.”

And another: “4th of July was very strong off-prem, especially large format,” though “on-premise is slowing.”

And another: “We had a great fourth in [Midwest]. Sell through was strong.” But they “missed some Coors Light sales” due to out-of-stocks.

It wasn’t the only brewer who was flagged for supply. One wholesaler mentioned “huge” STZ beer out-of-stocks, but still proclaimed them the “winner” of the holiday: “Other than that, July 4th was a big success.  Our beer business is up 5% vs last June.” 

Notably a couple of wholesalers did mention gas price pressures. And one in a sweltering region said their holiday was soft, “down 5% for the week,” despite having “dominated the display positions.” 

“…On balance I think a lot of people left town to get out of the heat. Difficult holiday for us and a lackluster month all around.”  

DEEP DISCOUNTS FROM RETAILERS.  But despite generally robust trends, note that some wholesalers flagged chains using beer as a loss leader. 

“Retailers are eating into their own margin to juice sales and traffic,” said one. “July 4th was deeper than Memorial Day.  Expect at-cost and even below-cost ads/programs balance of summer/year, until traffic counts stabilize.  Retailers are factoring in trade-down by offering multiple pack sizes, including much more aggressive prices/programs on premium 12pks.  Many core packages of domestic and seltzer were just slightly above cost. Sub-premium/budget pricing was generally left alone.”

Another simply said: “Premium lights grew and chains had aggressive loss leader (15.99 loose cans) pricing.”

Speaking of premium lights… 

SINKING SELTZERS… LEAD TO PREMIUM LIGHT BOOST.  Almost everyone noted depressed seltzer trends, and many also think that played into premium light’s good showing.

Said one: “Hard Seltzers down 15%, Constellation alone at the top with DD growth.  MC actually has some momentum of Coors Light, but HUSA down and most of craft down too. … Seltzer is likely providing regular light lager a bit of a boost.” (Note, many called out tough craft trends last weekend.)

And another says “seltzers were still down despite very aggressive pricing.”

And yet another says “seltzers down 20% (we have almost all of them) in June with some tough inventory issues for Truly. “

Another wholesaler reports that seltzer was down “but cutting [its] deficit trend,” while they simultaneously saw a “small spike in premium lights,” which they attributed to possible trade down.  

Speaking of trade down, one distributor said that “Keystone Light continues to be our highest volume brand … With so much inflation we’re seeing big growth here,” but they haven’t seen increased trade down with their other economy brands. This wholesaler is also seeing robust MC domestic premium buoyancy, with  “Coors Light and Miller Lite holding their own” for the 4th. 

SUGAR IS BACK? One wholesaler who noted double-digit decreases for seltzer says they “more than made up for it” — as “FMB’s (Twisted, Cayman, Jack Daniels) were up 33%- that segment is 20% bigger than seltzer!”

They continued: “Simply is HOT and appeals to all demographics (except soccer moms who look at sugar content). If we had inventory it could be HUGE.”

Another quipped, “Sugar is back? Mike’s – Twisted Tea, other non-‘better for you’ brands all up!” 

NON-ALC SPARKS. A few also mentioned that non-alcs moved the needle over the holiday. 

“Non-Alcs (not beer) are a game changer for us and if the retail is 1.99 or higher it’s worth the single bottle merchandising,” says one. “Alani, C4, PRIME HOT HOT HOT and BioSteel finally catching on a bit.”

We’ll keep you posted as the picture develops more. 

IRI: BEER SEES STRONG MOMENTUM HEADING INTO THE FOURTH

We’re still waiting on the final off-premise tallies from the Fourth, but judging by the above comments from distribs and the lead up week to July 4, things are looking promising.

Indeed, beer actually grew sales in the week ending June 26, up nearly 2%, per IRI multi-outlet and convenience data. 

Leading the way in growth for beer over the week were the usual suspects, with Twisted Tea up 44%, New Belgium up 26.7%, Modelo up 24%, the Busch brand fam up 12.4% and Michelob up 8.6%.

But all in, it was a pretty broad growth story for beer during the week. 

Seven of the top ten suppliers grew dollars, as MC was up 2.6%, Constellation grew 14.2%, Mark Anthony notched 1.1% growth, Boston Beer snagged 2% growth, Diageo Beer Co. grew 3.5%, Kirin/Lion jumped 18.8% and Yuengling hit double-digits (+10.5%). 

And seven of the top ten beer brand fams grew dollars over the week too: Modelo up 24%, Michelob up 8.6%, Corona up 6.5%, Coors up 0.7%, Miller Lite up 3.2%, Busch up 12.4% and Natural Light up 1.1%

A-B HOOKS UP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS

Anheuser-Busch announced today that it has struck a five-year agreement with The University of Texas Athletics to become “the exclusive domestic and craft beer sponsor” of the program.

The new deal awards A-B with “exclusive in-stadium advertising rights for domestic and craft beer,” and also gives the supplier “non-exclusive rights for ready-to-drink canned cocktail beverages,” per announcement.

Look for A-B to highlight its brands “through multiple university platforms, including videoboard and field level signage, balcony LED ribbons, concourse level activations, and Longhorns media and broadcast integrations across social, digital, print, tv, and radio.”

It appears that A-B picked up the deal (at least the exclusive domestic sponsorship) from Molson Coors, as MC announced five years ago that it had struck a multi-year deal for Coors Light to be the exclusive domestic sponsor of UT Athletics.

Suffice it to say, it’s a big get for A-B and its local distributor, Brown Distributing.

Indeed, Laurie Brown, VP of Brown Distributing, said they are “thrilled to be partnering with Anheuser-Busch on this sponsorship of Texas Athletics, and we can’t wait to help make the game day experience a little sweeter for 21+ fans.” 

And while Brown will reap the benefits of the deal in Austin, the entire A-B network in the Lone Star State stands to gain from the partnership too, as new limited-edition Bud Light packaging that carries the ‘Hook ‘em Horns’ rally cry is set to roll before football season (see brewpic below).

The co-branded packaging, which hits exclusively in the state of Texas starting September 1, will be available in 16-oz. aluminum bottles of Bud Light as well as 12 oz cans in 12- and 24-packs.

PABST OUTDOES ITSELF WITH WALLOPING 1844-PACK OF PBR 

First it was the 99-pack, last year it was the 1776-pack, and this year, well, this year Pabst is going even bigger with an enormous 1844-pack. 

Yep, the massive pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon has returned this summer with 68 more beers for an 1844-pack, a nod to the year Pabst was founded. 

And unlike the 1776-pack last year, this latest monstrosity will actually show up in stores. 

Indeed, Pabst has created 250 actual 1844-packs this go-round, reports Forbes. The packs, which stand “four feet tall by three and a half feet wide” will arrive at various accounts — “from large retail chains to popular PBR bars, to smaller independent liquor stores,” – empty, and “it is up to them to fill it as they see fit,” per report. 

“The idea is that the 1844-pack creates an event wherever it’s located. We want people to stop and shoot photos of it and tell their friends about it. Hopefully, it stops people in their tracks and gets them to grab our beer,” director of national accounts, Lee Dixon, told Forbes.

Pabst is also holding an #1844 sweepstakes with the rollout, giving away $1,844 every day in July, and also offering two chances (once in July and another in August) to win 1,844 gallons of gas.

BEER BRIEF:

BUD LIGHT NEXT LAUNCHES SUMMER VACAY GIVEAWAY. Bud Light NEXT will send eleven 21+ beer fans on a summer vacation this year, as part of its “Summer of Endless Possibilities” campaign. The summer sweepstakes comes as many Americans are finally ready to pull the trigger on that summer vacation they’ve been putting off. A recent poll conducted by The Vacationer, shows that 81% of consumers are planning to travel in some capacity this summer. So, Bud Light NEXT is stepping in to help a handful of lucky fans with their travel plans. “Each week for the remainder of the summer, Bud Light NEXT is awarding consumers and a guest with fully paid airfare and a two-night stay at any destination in the U.S.,” per announcement. The brand will also award a grand prize to one lucky traveler, which will take the traveler and five guests on a four-day all-inclusive vacation plus paid airfare. Bud Light NEXT has done nearly $35 million in sales and gained 0.18 points of off-premise beer share YTD, per IRI MULC data thru June 12. That’s a little more than Elysian Space Dust (A-B’s biggest craft brand) has done in sales this year."
Grokking Price Gaps,"“If we don’t have a GREAT Weekend of Sales this time, I fear we have lost 2022.”

That’s from the laptop of consultant Bump Williams last Friday in a note to clients, referring to the Super Bowl of beer sales: the long Independence Day weekend. We’ll have more color on that coming up, but first let’s consider what’s on everybody’s mind: pricing in an environment of high inflation, high gas prices, and the crash of stocks, bonds, and crypto. How much pricing can beer safely take? 

With gas pricing so high, it appears consumers are making more trips to c-stores as they’re often not filling up the tank full so they have money left over for that tall boy or pack of cigs. (Another reason Busch Light is fairing well — it is a c-store staple and is filling the hole MHL Light and Hamm’s left).  

BEER LAGGING. As I’ve said before, much of what beer pricing does depends on what the spirits guys do (particularly Tito’s), and they don’t seem to be in any hurry to jack up prices. But even within the beer category — if we assume that Constellation is now the lead arbiter of pricing power as it dominates the high end — pricing has lagged general CPG inflation, and Constellation chief Bill Newlands has indicated that despite this fact they will be continuing to target 1 to 2% average price increases, in order not to spook the consumer out of the beer category altogether. Bill wishes to “maintain our consumer base which ultimately at the end of the day is what it’s all about.” While these are “extraordinary times,” he believes it’s “important” to “remain balanced, sensible” and refrain from getting caught up in the moment and make moves “that I would describe as anti-consumer.” (Ed. Notes: see BBD 07-01-2022; and more on general beer pricing and promos later this week)

VOLATILE SEGMENT PRICING. Bump says he has been asked to “conduct studies on Price Gaps, Price Thresholds, Price Elasticity and Cross-Elasticity.” And one interesting thing they found is that the deviation in average pricing between segments within the beer category has gotten bigger. And as we all know, when price gaps widen, we see consumer behavior start to change. 

In 2021, “segments like Craft and Domestic Premium (both at +2.6%) saw a notable uptick compared to prior years where the Avg EQ Price change was much less pronounced,” writes Bump.  “On top of that, Below Premium, Imports, FMBs and Cider all jumped up to at or above the +3% threshold for YoY change.” 

In 2022 so far, Bump and his team are seeing seltzer, cider, below premium, and premium average pricing outpace other segments.  

GAPS WIDENING. Also, the price gaps between segments are widening.  “In 2018, the Avg. EQ Price gap between Premium and Import was ~$10/Case whereas today, that gap has increased to ~$12/Case.  Similarly, the gap between Premium and Craft has jumped from ~$16 to ~$17/Case which although is not a major shift in magnitude on the surface, as those gaps continue to widen there is eventually going to be a breaking point among some shoppers who are willing to consider trading down certain occasions during tougher economic times.”

BOTTOM LINE. No wonder Newlands is taking a more measured approach.  But with Constellation being conservative, that creates an impenetrable price ceiling for all the others who ‘mind the gaps’ — and even if you don’t mind the gaps, if Modelo Especial won’t up aggressively, I don’t see many other brands with more built-in equity.

SPIRITS RTDS SLAY SELTZER FOR THE FOURTH ON DRIZLY, WHILE CORONA, TOPO AND TWISTED CLIMB 

Drizly’s July 4th results are in, and one early winner is clear: spirits-based RTDs. 

Having surpassed seltzer for the first time over the Memorial Day holiday, spirits RTDs “widened the gap” between their own and seltzer’s share of sales on Drizly over the most recent holiday weekend.  

“The share of RTD sales grew nearly 2% year over year for the 4th of July weekend” on the platform, “while Hard Seltzers decreased by more than 1%,” the company shared with BBD. 

Specifically, spirits-based RTDs snagged 5.4 share of Drizly sales over July 4 weekend (July 1-4, 2022), up from 3.6 share during July 4th weekend 2021 (July 2 – 5, 2021). 

But seltzer’s standing went the other way. Seltzer snagged 4.7% share of sales on Drizly this July 4, down from 5.9% share last year. 

“This mirrors the trend seen on Drizly over Memorial Day weekend 2022, when RTDs first surpassed hard seltzer,” per spokesperson. 

BEER LOSES SHARE. The rise of spirits and the fall of malt seltzer made beer gains unlikely on the platform over the holiday.  

Indeed, beer overall lost several sharepoints over the holiday, ceding most of them to spirits, and a sliver to wine. 

Beer was 18 share of sales for this July 4, with liquor at 48 share and wine at 31.  But beer held 21 share on Drizly last July 4, with liquor at 46 and wine at 30. 

HOWEVER, SOME BEER BRANDS CLIMBED.  But did any beer brands gain share on Drizly over the holiday, we wondered? 

Indeed:  “During the 2022 July 4th weekend, Corona reached the No. 2 top-selling beer brand on Drizly (up from No. 4 during July 4th weekend 2021),” Driziy told BBD. 

“For flavored malt beverages, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer reached the No. 9 spot over the 2022 July 4th weekend (up from No. 12) and Twisted Tea reached No. 14 (up from 18). 

Note, however, that Corona only gained share in the beer category specifically. “Twisted Tea, however, gained share across all sales, jumping from No 104 on 2021 July 4th weekend to No 89 in 2022 during the same time period and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer from No 79 to No 53,” per Drizly. 

AND NA BEER A BRIGHT SPOT. Another silver lining: on a much smaller base, non-alc beer grew a ton over the holiday, going from 0.56 share last holiday on the platform to 0.95 this year. Meanwhile, NA spirits were flat, at 0.05 share both years, and NA wine grew slightly, from 0.10 share last year to 0.22 share this past holiday weekend. 

DRIZLY’S TOP SELLING BEER BRANDS FOR JULY 4. Finally, Drizly’s top selling beer brands over the holiday weekend were as follows:

1. Corona

2. Bud Light

3. Coors

4. Miller Brewing Co

5. Michelob

6. Modelo

7. Heineken

8. Budweiser

9. Stella Artois

10. Blue Moon

DIAGEO LEVERAGES VITA COCO FOR NEW RUM COCONUT WATER RTDS

The latest giant global company to boozify a known non-alcoholic entity? 

That would be Diageo, with The Vita Coco Company. They’re teaming up for a line of RTDs featuring Captain Morgan rum and Coco coconut water. 

The resulting spirits-based RTD line, called Vita Coco Spiked with Captain Morgan, will launch in three flavors: Pina Colada, Strawberry Daiquiri, and Lime Mojito. The RTDs will be 5% abv, with a suggested retail price of $14.99 per 4-pack of 12 oz. cans. (Notably, former longtime Boston Beer chief Martin Roper leads Vita Coco these days, so they certainly aren’t flying blind here.) 

Diageo will produce, distribute and market the products, which are due to hit the national stage early next year. The company tells BBD the products will go through its spirits wholesalers, “with the exception of certain Control Markets where spirits-based RTD’s (based upon state regulations) will be distributed via other, to be determined, distributor networks.”

Rum-based cocktails are up 269% in the U.S. (per announcement, citing Nielsen xAOC 52-week numbers to 2-5), with”piña coladas, daiquiris, and mojitos leading as the most dynamic cocktail types,” which are growing at a faster clip than the spirits-based RTD category.  

“With Captain Morgan having the #1 selling spiced rum brand[1] and Vita Coco as the #1 selling coconut water[2], this relationship brings together two category-leading brands,” it said. 

This is the latest RTD play from the giant global spirits player, but it won’t be the last. 

“Cocktail drinkers are looking for convenient ways to enjoy high quality classic tropical drinks, especially rum-based ones,” said Diageo North America president Debra Crew. “As we continue expanding our ready-to-drink portfolio, we consider ways to elevate the category, and it just made sense to marry together two premium brands that are loved by consumers around the world.”

DIAGEO THE NUMBER THREE RTD SPIRITS PLAYER, MOSTLY ON THE BACK OF CROWN ROYAL. While Diageo is a top international spirits producer, it trails Gallo (with High Noon) and A-B (with Cutwater Spirits) in the ready-to-drink space .  

They are the number 3 spirits RTD manufacturer for the U.S. market, but still ahead of other giant bev alc names like Jim Beam and Pernod Ricard. Diageo’s RTD dollar sales are up almost 68% YTD, per data shared by Dave Williams at BWC Company (YTD, week ended June 25 for TUS All Outlets).

The bulk of their RTD dollar sales come via the Crown Royal brand, at roughly 64% share. It’s sort of a quiet powerhouse, as the no. 5 RTD brand family (behind, in order, High Noon, Cutwater, Monaco, and On The Rocks). 

After Crown Royal cans, Diageo RTDs break out like this: 

Ketel One ~10%

Loyal Nine ~10% (note, Diageo acquired this young lemonade brand, which reminds us of a Fishers Island, last spring)

Ciroc ~6%

Tanqueray ~6%

Bulleit ~3%

Capt Morgan <0.1% 

Notice the paucity of rum-based brands there. 

Indeed, in the RTD universe, “most top-selling brands are either Vodka or Tequila based, with Whiskey also peppering the lineup which does indicate room for more Rum-based beverages to crack the top 50 besides Cutwater Mai Tai, Bacardi Rum Punch and Malibu Daiquiri,” said Dave. 

BREWERY CHIEFS TO BIDEN: SET OUR CANS FREE

As the Biden Administration looks for ways to relieve the pressures of inflation, leaders in the beer industry have submitted an idea: lifting the Section 232 aluminum tariffs.

Indeed, chiefs from four major breweries (Brendan Whitworth of A-B, Gavin Hattersley of Molson Coors, Maggie Timoney of Heineken and Jim Sabia of Constellation Beer, alongside the Beer Institute) sent a letter to President Biden last week urging him to eliminate the tariffs, noting how tariff relief results in inflation relief. 

The letter highlighted that the “American beverage industry has paid more than $1.4 billion in Section 232 aluminum tariffs since 2018,” and pointed out that “these tariffs reverberate throughout the supply chain, raising production costs for aluminum end-users and ultimately impacting consumer prices.”

The chiefs believe the lifting of such tariffs will “provide critical relief to American workers, domestic job creators,” and will “alleviate pressure and allow us to continue our vital role as strong contributors to this nation’s economy.”

The letter also called out that the elimination of Section 232 tariffs is a move that many are aligned on, as “the Peterson Institute recently found that removing both the existing duties and quotas on aluminum is a critical piece of anti-inflationary policy.”

BEER BRIEF:

A-B’s PRESIDENTE LAUNCHES “STEP UP TO THE PLATE” PROGRAM. Dominican pilsner brand, Presidente, will look to create “more opportunities for Hispanic students interested in a career in sports” through a new initiative called, “Step Up to the Plate.” The summer-long program will “help fuel a pipeline of qualified candidates into the business side of the industry by offering internship and networking opportunities, as well as financial support,” per announcement. Indeed, A-B has partnered with the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, to award “nine deserving students a three-month paid internship working on projects across the business that include a strategic sports focus, in collaboration with the Sports Marketing team at A-B.” On top of the internship, Step Up to the Plate will award each student “a grant for living expenses in a combined package worth approximately $15K, as well as the opportunity to join A-B in a full-time role following graduation.”

BREWPIC:  From Bump Williams Consulting, see how the pricing within segments in beer have changed over time. "
"What Oregon Giveth, Michigan Taketh","The May 2022 state shipments estimate from the Beer Institute pegs May down 0.4%, and year-to-date shipments down 1.1%.  But beneath the sheen of those staid and muted trends turmoil lurks, as the delta in top performing states and lagging states widens. The most dramatic contrast: Oregon is up 30% so far this year, while Michigan is down 7%; but in real terms to-date, Oregon is contributing the most barrels in the nation, and Michigan losing the most. 

Ed. Note: When ranking a state’s performance against all others, percent change in volume doesn’t serve as a meaningful metric when states differ so much in population. So instead we looked at each state’s change in volume as a percentage of the nation’s total volume; i.e. their change in market share.

Year-to-date, Oregon seems to be punching way above its weight as the small-ish state contributed the most volume growth to national sales. Texas, N. Carolina, Nevada and Indiana all have gained over a tenth of a point of share. 

As for the share losers ytd, Michigan, New York, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and Illinois lost the most share. California is also a top ten volume drainer, but luckily the volume California has lost ytd is almost exactly made up by gains in Iowa. Loses in Kansas were matched by gains in Wisconsin. Nevada’s W is offset by Missouri’s L. We truly are a nation of dichotomies.

In May itself, the improvement in trend is due to growth in several large beer states, including Ohio (+9%), Colorado (+4.7%), Pennsylvania (+4%), Florida (+3.1%), and New York (+0.9%).

DOM SHIPMENTS IMPROVE. Recall that the BI reported that domestic taxpaid May shipments were down -2.2%, also improving sequentially. Chris Carey at Wells Fargo reminds us that “shipments have now declined in 10 of the past 11 months (March was up +2.9%).”

But do not despair. Covid has once again played the fool with our numbers.  The 2-year stacked trend remains “positive at +5.6% (year-ago comp was +7.8%—2nd toughest for the year), accelerating from April’s +2.1% 2-year (-5.9% vs a +8.0% comp). May shipments were -4.1% lower relative to May 2019 (pre-pandemic),” says Chris.

COMPS GET EASIER.  The worst is behind us, as April and May faced the toughest comps for domestic shipments (+8.0%/+7.8% respectively).  The upcoming June comp is flat, and then a “much easier in H2, particularly July-September. This may set the stage for a turn positive y/y.”

SPECIAL PROFILE:  THE BEER SALT QUEEN 

Everybody knows that Corona is usually consumed with lime. Old-timers in Texas and Mexico recall consumers in the 80s regularly salted the rim of their cans of Tecate to balance out the bitter, along with fruits and vegetables and candy. It was around this time that San Antonio businessman Roger Treviño was traveling in Mexico and had an idea:  bring flavored salts to the U.S. He started packaging his beer salts, which he called Twang, in his garage and selling it to local indie c-stores. 

Growth was steady over the years, but a big break came when their vp marketing, Edmundo Macias, who came from A-B, cut a cross-merchandising deal with Tequiza, (which we note was a brand clearly before its time). That ability to sell Twang as an upsell on beer displays brought Twang immediate name recognition for consumers, and getting your beer “dressed” became a common ritual. 

Today Twang has 75 employees and operates out of a 50k facility in San Antonio, and is now run by Roger Trevino’s daughter, Elysia Treviño-Gonzales, who spent an afternoon with BBD waxing euphoric about beer salts. “It’s all about elevating the experience” of drinking beer, says Elysia.      

NOT JUST FOR MEXICAN BEER.  Beer salts are obviously paired mostly with Mexican beers, but increasingly Elysia says that the custom is branching out into other areas.  When they used to attend craft brewer conferences in years past, Elysia says they were “laughed out of the room.” Nobody would dream of ‘tainting’ their precious creation with salt. 

But today’s consumer is much more willing to try unconventional things and new flavors. Twang has branded deals to provide flavorings for a few craft brewers, (Alamo Brewing of SA and Martin House Brewing of Dallas are two examples), as well as cross-merchandising deals with other beer brands (tied in with another product for legal reasons). 

And while their big sellers continue to be their core flavors — lemon-lime, lime, pickled, chili-lime — they have also created a major business creating custom salts and blends for retailers and producers (a proprietary blend for Applebee’s and HEB, for example) as well as licensing agreements (they market a Clamato salt). 

On-premise is a growth opportunity for the brand as Covid restrictions ease up.  They don’t have much exposure to beer DSD, but Elysia says it would be a natural product for distributors to offer accounts as an upsell, as the margin is there and it doesn’t compete with other beverages.  

DISTRIBUTION.  As for distribution, they’ve been going through the normal ‘beer salt’ foodservice-type channels, but are currently exploring being distributed through beer distributors themselves, as an add-on product.  “The margins are similar to a case of beer,” Edmundo says. “And it’s completely incremental — it doesn’t cut into your other beer brands.” 

BEER BRIEF:

CRESCENT CROWN TAPS DOUBLE GREEN FOR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. Crescent Crown Distributing has teamed up with sustainability firm, Double Green, to “reduce costs and greenhouse gas emissions throughout its operations,” per release. Crescent Crown – which has run its Arizona warehouse ops through its own rooftop solar power system since 2012, and added almost 100% more solar capacity through a carport system installed in 2020 – says it has seen “the financial value” in their renewable energy investments, and “certain” it will find “even greater savings” with Double Green’s help. “By partnering with Double Green, we’ll have a roadmap for continuous sustainable improvement to quantifiably reduce our environmental impact and that of the brands we represent,” said Crescent Crown president Bubba Moffett.

Constellation Walking a “Delicate Line” on Pricing,"There were lots of questions on pricing during Constellation’s earnings call yesterday, but not a lot of movement on the company’s stance. 

Constellation chief Bill Newlands assured listeners that they are monitoring the environment “almost on a daily basis,” and will be “ready to adjust [their] approach if that proves to be necessary or appropriate.”

Still, there are no plans to change their long-term algorithm of 1% to 2% increases, as they believe the strategy “works well” for them and provides them with “flexibility” to react to developments over the course of the year. 

POPULIST PRICING FOR A PREMIUM PROPOSITION. Furthermore, the strategy “helps us maintain our consumer base which ultimately at the end of the day is what it’s all about,” said Bill.

Indeed, Bill acknowledged that we are in “extraordinary times,” and in these times, he believes it’s “important” to “remain balanced, sensible” and refrain from getting caught up in the moment and make moves “that I would describe as anti-consumer.”

So, Constellation intends to be “judicious” on this front, and balance “the understanding that there are a lot of pressures that our consumers and all consumers are under because of inflationary pressures in the market.”

One analyst pointed out that Constellation’s Q1 price mix is above the 1% to 2% increase that Constellation has stuck to. 

Bill confirmed that the data “certainly shows” that “the pricing scenario at the moment is above the 1%-2% algorithm.” Though he notes that that is “being taken either at the distributor level or at the retail level to hit specific price points.”

To conclude the talk on pricing, Bill said, “we’re trying to walk the delicate line of what’s appropriate, what can we do to reflect and address the rising cost that we are all facing while keeping our consumer base. We think that’s in the long-term interest not only of our company but for the category as well.”

SHIPMENTS/DEPLETIONS CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR. The other big highlight from the call? An apparent discrepancy between beer shipment and depletion trends in the latest quarter. 

While the trends reported may have looked like the company shipped much more beer (+17%) than it depleted (+9%). The absolutes were roughly the same, Bill clarified, and they “expect that to remain over the course of the year.”

Constellation CFO Garth Hankinson explained that trends will look “a little lumpy” over the course of the year, as they cycle “weather-related activities,” production issues and inventory rebuilds from last year. “So it’ll just be a bit of a lumpy year.”

Still, Garth said that they continue to expect “strong depletions” over the course of the year, and “will continue to have shipment growth that is in line with our long-term algorithm.” 

Speaking of, Bill noted that the read on June (the first month of their fiscal Q2) looks to be “another very solid month” for their beer biz, and “is consistent with what our expectations are for the year.

“So our anticipation is that we’re going to continue to see a very solid year-in our beer business as the year progresses, recognizing there’s a lot of unknown variables that are going to go on relative to the economy,” Bill said.

Hard to disagree, given their recent highlights….

CONSTELLATION TOPS IN SHARE GAINS OVER MEMORIAL DAY. For instance, Bill pointed out that Constellation beer was “the number one share gainer” over Memorial Day, “capturing 1.5 share points of total beer and 2.3 points of high-end beer in tracked channels.” And he called out “an important milestone” for its beer biz, as it has “reached more than five full points in shares gained over the last five years.”

UP 30% IN THE ON-PREMISE OVER Q1. Then too, they’re seeing strong growth in the on-premise with depletions up 30% in the channel over the quarter. Garth noted that the on-premise now “accounts for approximately 13% of our depletion volume versus 11% in Q1 fiscal 2022 when the on-premise channel continued to be somewhat affected by the pandemic.”

AND MORE BRANDS IN THE PIPELINE. They’ve got things cooking as well. Bill shared on the call that they continue to be “encouraged by the initial data” they’re seeing for their Modelo innovations in test markets, particularly for Modelo Oro.

And don’t forget that the launch of Fresca Mixed is just around the corner. The canned cocktail done in partnership with Coke is set to debut in early September (not August, as previously estimated), with two flavors: Vodka Spritz and Tequila Paloma.

BRUCE JACOBSON ON GROWING BIOSTEEL: HE’S DONE THIS BEFORE 

We got newly announced BioSteel president (and longtime Constellation Beer vet) Bruce Jacobson on the horn yesterday to dig in on how he came to the post, his initial plan of attack, and more.

Bruce’s appointment, a tried-and-trusted entity for Constellation Beer wholesalers who carry the ‘Steel, clearly signifies majority stakeholder Canopy Growth doubling down on the brand. 

He’s got his work cut out for him, moving BioSteel up the ranks against sports drink giants like Body Amor, Powerade and Gatordate — ‘cause he did a similar thing on the beer side at Constellation. 

The BioSteel team tells us the product is less than a 1 share of the US sports hydration segment in U.S. multi-outlet plus convenience. In its home market of Canada, it is over a 5 share (in the channels they track). 

It’s still a very young brand in the U.S., with the company announcing regional distribution of its new RTD Tetra Pack beverages only about 1.5 years ago through the Gold Network.

It’s really only starting to hit mainstream retailers, but it has seen some growing pains with its beer wholesalers to date, who say it has been slow going so far [see BBD 06-16-2022]. 

But Bruce is ready to work with these distributors.  And he says the brand will get outsized investments to help it along. 

Read on. 

ON HOW HE CAME TO THE POST. But first, how’d Bruce get here? He’d just been on the leadership team of PRESS hard seltzer. 

Canopy CEO David Klein was “close colleagues” with Bruce during their days at Constellation, when David was CFO of the beer business. They have a good working relationship, says Bruce. 

David recognizes potential and upside in the BioSteel brand, “and said, ‘you know what? I think we can add some people into this organization to help it accelerate, and invest into BioSteel.’ That’s when he came to me and said, ‘’Do you have any interest in doing this?'” 

Bruce calls the appointment “one of those really good, kind of perfect timing situations,” because “we’re on the verge of something I think fairly special with BioSteel in North America, in a category that is somewhat detached from the beer business, but at the same time can be incremental volume for those same organizations.” 

BRUCE HAS THE “ROADMAP.” He points out that “the work that has to be done here in the near term, is work that I’ve done before. And so we’ve got a little bit of a roadmap and a game plan for what that looks like already.”

We asked what sort of Constellation Beer playbook roadmap he might bring to bear at BioSteel. The framework is the same, says Bruce, but the “roadmap” is different because the category is different, as are the competitors, and timing.

But “there’s definitely a framework that can be built upon. It’s a framework that’s built on the structure of authenticity. … The beer brands that I’ve been a part of building have always had this authenticity to them. That’s been leveraged in the marketing, and the consumer really makes that connection with it. I think that exact same authenticity is here in BioSteel.”

This is a brand that “started in the NHL locker rooms,” he said. Indeed, it was founded by 15-year NHL Michael Cammalleri and business partner John Celenza in 2009.

“Just a couple of days ago, I spent a little time with the Toronto Blue Jays,” and their president was talking about how their organization has embraced BiosSteel.

“That’s that authenticity of, some of the most elite athletes in the world are using the brand and now we’re kind of giving that opportunity to the consumer side of it.

“And so we know that we’ve gotta be focused on building the brand through distribution and building the brand through velocity. 

“We’re still fairly new in the marketplace, especially in the United States. And because of the pandemic, it wasn’t as easy getting out into the marketplace like you normally would do, during that window of time from introduction.

THE DISTRIB FACTOR. “And I think you actually wrote a little bit about it a few weeks ago,” he told BBD, referencing our mid-June article. “And you talked about … some feedback from the distributor network on that. So there’s room for this to become even stronger. And that’s why David asked me to come on board and help do that. …

“And so, we think that there is a lot of upside to tell the story of Biosteel; help the distributors understand the incrementality for themselves; the incrementality of the non alc category for many of them. Because as you know — I’ll use the Gold Network term, but distributors as a whole –you know, some of them have embraced the non-alc business and looked at themselves and said that, you know, the future lies in beverage distribution, not necessarily any one single category. Different wholesalers are in different parts of that process. …

“And so the distributors that have been talking about those things and taking action against them for the last several years are probably a little further along than the ones that are still in the talking phase, or are just starting to get into diversifying from beer to NA or spirits and wine.

“And so there’s no question that the message has to be slightly different because some understand the incrementality of NA and have put a lot of energy and investment behind it.”

“FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS” UNDER WAY… Bruce had used the word “investment,” a few times, so we asked about particulars there: Where they will invest for the brand, and how much.

“There’s gonna be some things that you will see from an investment standpoint, [and] things that are already there, by the way. So …  given the size of the portfolio or the brand itself right now, we’ve already invested in fairly significant internal structure in people. We are constantly looking at that, saying, ‘where do we need to apply more resources’ in that fashion.

“From a marketing standpoint, the budgets are pretty robust for a brand this size. You’ll see some evidence of that, which I can’t comment on right now. But we’ll have a conversation in the next few weeks, about some fairly significant investments that are visible to the network. ” Even if they don’t disclose specific investment numbers, it will be “fairly obvious that it was a significant investment,” and “beyond normal for a brand the size of BioSteel.”

In the end, “I think you’re gonna see that BioSteel really does aspire to be a significant contributor in this category and significant contributor to the vision of the distributors that are looking at expanding into, into the NA business and the ones that are already there,” says Bruce.

Have a safe and prosperous Independence Day; barring any breaking news we will be back in your inbox on Tuesday.

"Another Boringly Great Quarter from Constellation Beer, Shipments up 17%","Constellation Beer continues to outdo itself.

The company — which recorded a rather robust Q1 this time last year, having grown depletions and shipments by about 11% — has cruised through those difficult comps in its latest Q1 results (three months ended May 31 2022) with depletion growth of nearly 9% and shipment growth of 17%.

BRAND HIGHLIGHTS. Modelo Especial and Corona Extra continue to perform. Modelo depletions were up 15% in the quarter, while Corona managed to grow depletions again, up 4%. They’re still eating other beers’ lunches: Modelo is the very top brand share gainer in all of U.S. beer, and the top high-end brand, while Corona is the no. 2 share gainer for imports, and the no. 3 high-end beer.

Pacifico, which had some issues with brown glass availability, is regaining distribution after better supply, with depletions up 21%. 

Then too, Modelo Chelada remains the top chelada in U.S. beer, ringing in nearly 40% depletion growth over the quarter and “expanding its share to more than half of the entire chelada segment.”

NET SALES UP 21%. Between those crazy shipments (and maybe some pricing levers), net sales clocked in at a hefty 21%, easily outdoing the prior quarter’s 14%. STZ Beer continues to expect net sales growth of 7%-9% for FY 2023. 

MORE CAPACITY COMING. Constellation also noted that it “plans to invest in the next increment of capacity in Mexico” for its beer business. As previously announced, the company’s beer business is expected to spend $5 billion to $5.5 billion on total capex over fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, with “the majority” of that spend occurring in “the first three months of that timeframe.”

The company says the investment “will support the addition of up to 30 million hectoliters of modular capacity and includes the construction of a new brewery in Southeast Mexico in the state of Veracruz, as well as continued expansion, optimization, and/or construction at the company’s existing sites in Nava and Obregon,” per release.

CONSTELLATION ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT WITH SANDS BROTHERS TO ELIMINATE CLASS B COMMON STOCK; NOW IT GOES TO SHAREHOLDERS

This morning the company also announced an agreement with the Sands family to eliminate its Class B Common stock. 

Following the recommendation of a special committee, Constellation’s Board of Directors has approved the proposal, and will recommend to shareholders for approval. 

What’s more, if the reclassification is successfully completed, Robert and Richard Sands, “who currently serve as Executive Chairman of the Board and Executive Vice Chairman of the Board, respectively, will retire from their employment with Constellation Brands in their current executive capacities. Robert Sands will become Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and Richard Sands will continue on as a Board member.”

Recall earlier this year that the Sands family had sent a non-binding proposal to declassify the company’s common stock and transition to a single class common stock structure [see BBD 04-05-2022]. The new structure, reducing Sands’ voting power, could make the stock more appealing to investors. (The Sands Family will continue to be Constellation’s largest shareholder after the reclassification.)

“The proposed transaction contemplates that each outstanding share of the company’s Class B common stock, including those owned by the Sands Family, will be converted into the right to receive one share of Class A common stock plus cash consideration in the amount of $64.64 per share of Class B common stock, or a total amount of $1.5 billion,” the company said today. “This represents a 26.5% premium relative to Constellation’s Class A common stock closing share price as of June 29, 2022.”

Among the benefits Constellation sees for proposed reclassification are “simplification of the Company’s equity capital structure to better align the voting rights and interests of all shareholders”; “broader appeal of its shares to a larger base of investors who prefer single voting class common stock structures”; and “operating cost savings associated with executive salary and certain benefits ($15-20 million of cost in fiscal 2022),” among other things. 

BIOSTEEL BRINGS BRUCE JACOBSON ON AS CHIEF, ANGLING TO BE A “TOP 4 SPORTS HYDRATION COMPANY”

It was barely two weeks ago that we reported Canopy Growth’s (majority owned) sports hydration drink, BioSteel, would make a big push in thousands of Walmarts [see BBD 06-16-2022] across 37 states, with plans to go on sale at Walmart.com for consumers nationwide later this year. 

The brand is ambitious: Canopy CCO Julious Grant told BBD earlier this spring that the brand is climbing the ranks of sports drinks, having received authorizations for over 15,000 stores across the U.S and sitting as the no. 6 or 7 player [see BBD 03-15-2022].

And now news hits this morning of another big development for the brand: Constellation vet Bruce Jacobson has been appointed BioSteel’s president. 

Bruce has a tall order: to accelerate the growth of BioSteel “into a top-4 sports hydration company,” alongside BioSteel co-founders John Celenza and Michael Cammalleri, per announcement. That should make the Gold Network, which carries it, happy.

Last time we spoke with Constellation vet Bruce Jacobson, he was COO at PRESS, where he moved in 2020 after a long tenure as Constellation Beer CCO. As with Canopy Growth, Constellation has a minority stake in PRESS (which currently holds 0.4% of the entire hard seltzer category ([malt and spirit-based], and is down 26.1% in the latest four weeks of NielsenAOC data, per the latest hard seltzer dashboard from Jefferies).

The BioSteel announcement noted that Bruce and his team at Constellation Beer achieved “36 consecutive quarters of industry-leading growth, while delivering an aggregate of more than $5B in revenue and strong margins.”

David Klein, who worked alongside Bruce at Constellation as CFO before he became chief at Canopy Growth, called Bruce “an invaluable addition to the company’s leadership team as BioSteel continues to grow at a record pace by challenging the status quo in hydration. 

“With deep experience building brands, driving profitability, developing distribution strategies, and leading cross-functional teams, we are confident that Bruce will complement and enhance the capabilities of the current leadership team and further advance BioSteel’s standing in the market.” 

For his part, Bruce said it was an “honor to join BioSteel and be a part of an innovative challenger brand that is already revolutionizing the sports hydration industry.” More soon. 

SEISMIC, REYES HAVE “AMICABLY RESOLVED ALL OUTSTANDING LEGAL DISPUTES”  

After tiny 6,000-barrel Sonoma County craft brewer Seismic Brewing (founded by Jackson Family Wine founders’ youngest son, Chris) filed a federal antitrust suit against Reyes and DBI in April (having already lost a California state suit against DBI), Reyes and Seismic issued a joint statement yesterday saying they’d “amicably resolved” all “legal disputes.” 

Here’s the short statement:

Reyes Holdings, L.L.C. and Harbor Distributing, L.L.C., together with WSJ, LLC d/b/a Seismic Brewing Co., Apple Cart Cider, LLC d/b/a Golden State Cider and Sonoma Craft Holdings, LLC, have determined it is in their mutual best interests to pursue potential business relationships going forward. Recognizing that litigation is inconsistent with these business objectives, the parties have also amicably resolved all outstanding legal disputes between them. Neither party has admitted any wrongdoing or liability, and the effect of the resolution is that neither side has any legal claims against the other. The parties are glad to have reached a mutual resolution of these legal matters and look forward to working together.

UP TO NOW. This has been a windy story with lots of turns, but …

Recall that all of this started after the Reyes/DBI deal two years ago. DBI actually sued Seismic first, in 2020, after the brewer refused to go to Reyes (to whom DBI had sold).  Then Seismic sued DBI, saying the wholesaler couldn’t assign its distribution rights to Reyes without that new wholesaler adhering to the brewer-favorable contract Seismic had negotiated with DBI [see BBD 08-25-2020], and throwing out accusations of anticompetitive behavior.

Earlier this spring, the California court threw out Seismic’s suit against DBI and Harbor, as well as Reyes (they’d been added to it). 

A month later, Seismic filed suit – in federal court this time – against both Reyes and DBI, making basically the same “anticompetitive” claims as in the suit that’d been thrown out. Seismic alleged the two conspired to “monopolize the California beer distribution market and unlawfully concentrate Reyes’ power for the purpose of destroying fair competition” and meant to “force Seismic and other craft brewers to ‘negotiate’ new, anticompetitive distribution agreements that make it virtually impossible to switch distributors upon the purported sham assignments of Seismic’s and these brewers’ distribution rights” [see BBD 04-15-2022].

And what about DBI? 

A court filing from Wednesday in US District Court, Northern District of California reveals that WSJ, LLC (d/b/a Seismic Brewing Company) “voluntarily dismisses with prejudice the above-entitled action against Defendants DBI Beverage Inc., DBI Beverage Napa, DBI Beverage Sacramento, DBI Beverage San Francisco, DBI Beverage San Joaquin, DBI Beverage San Jose, Reyes Holdings, LLC and Harbor Distributing, LLC.” 

SEISMIC AND REYES TO WORK TOGETHER? You might have noticed the line in the statement that says that Seismic and Reyes “have determined it is in their mutual best interests to pursue potential business relationships going forward.” 

After nearly two years of battling in the courtroom, the two companies now think they can do business with each other? What’s going on there?

The only thing that comes to mind, currently, is that Seismic’s founder, Chris Jackson, has moved even deeper into bev alc with the acquisition of Golden State Cider last month. He has big ambitions for the brand, which sold 600,000 cases last year in about a three state footprint. He told the SF Chronicle that he’s now looking to take the brand to “every state.” So perhaps they could link up outside of California? Plus, there’s the potential that Chris might snatch up even more brands. Stay tuned.

DOMESTIC SHIPMENTS DROP 2.2% IN MAY

Domestic shipments declined 2.2% over the month of May, representing a 326,000-barrel drop from May 2021, latest Beer Institute estimates show.

That’s an improvement over April, which saw domestic shipments down more than 850,000 barrels or -5.9%. Still, that improvement didn’t really budge the YTD trend.

Domestic shipments continue to be down low-single digits YTD (-3.3%), as declines have now been logged in four of the first five months of 2022. 

All in, domestic shipments are about 2.25 million barrels off of last year’s pace. 

The good news is, the toughest comps from 2021 (April and May both up 8%) are now out of the way. Going forward in 2022, there is only one more positive month (November +2.8%) to cycle."
Hazy and Traditional Imperial IPAs Lead Craft Through 1st Half of 2022,"Off-premise dollar sales of craft beer have declined -7.4% for the first half of 2022 compared to last year, according to NielsenIQ data analyzed by Bump Williams Consulting (BWC).

“Rate of decline has slowed a bit in Q2 (-6.4%) vs. Q1 (-8.5%), but the fact of the matter is that sales overall remain in the red, while several other segments have started to show signs of life,” BWC wrote.

BWC’s analysis tracks with the report Brewers Association (BA) chief economist Bart Watson published earlier this week that found craft beer declined -7.7% year-to-date through June 12. However, BWC’s data set runs through July 2, indicating that craft sales got a boost in the second half of June and the days leading up to July 4.

Within craft, only three of the segment’s top 20 styles are “experiencing any degree” of year-over-year dollar sales gains, BWC wrote. Craft’s top two growth segments are hazy imperial IPAs and traditional imperial IPAs, indicating that “ABVs are in demand.”

Dollar sales of imperial/double/triple IPAs increased +6.7% year-to-date through July 2, to $233.8 million in sales at off-premise grocery, convenience and liquor stores. The style gained +0.4% in craft dollar share.

Hazy imperial/double/triple IPAs dollar sales more than doubled, increasing +128.7% to $33.3 million, and gained +0.7% in craft dollar share.

Overall, IPAs accounted for 46% of craft dollar share, increasing share +1.8%, far outpacing any other craft style. Wheat ale, the second-largest craft style behind IPA, gained +0.2% share, increasing to 11% of craft dollars. The “other ale” style, in which BWC includes blonde ales and golden ales, increased +0.1% share, to 5% of craft dollars. Seasonal beers – the fourth-largest craft style behind No. 1 IPA, No. 2 wheat and No. 3 lager (9%) – lost -0.6% share, declining to 8% share of craft dollars.

American wheat ale was the only other craft style to grow its dollar sales after hazy and traditional imperial/double/triple IPAs. Dollar sales of the style increased +0.8%, to $71.3 million.

The only craft segment vendor to record dollar sales growth was Lion-owned New Belgium, which posted +14.8% growth year-to-date through July 2. The company also increased its dollar share within craft, adding +1.4% share for a total of 7.4%, making it the second-largest vendor in the segment, behind only Molson Coors (11.1% share of craft dollars), which is the parent company of Blue Moon Belgian White, the top craft brand in scan data.

Canal Street Brewing Co. (Founders) posted the steepest decline in dollar sales for the first half of the year, -15.3%, followed by Bell’s Brewery (-11.4%), Deschutes (-11%), Boston Beer (Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head, -10.4%), and Heineken (Lagunitas, -10.1%).

Of the top 25 craft brand families, non-alcoholic craft brewer Athletic Brewing posted the highest growth (+110.2%), followed by Anheuser-Busch InBev-owned Wicked Weed (+20%), New Belgium (+14.8%) and A-B’s Goose Island (+1.6%). All other craft brand families in the top 25 declined in dollar sales.

Beyond the top 25, Shelburne, Vermont-based Fiddlehead Brewing was the third-largest craft growth leader, increasing dollar sales +75.1%, behind New Belgium and Athletic. Bend, Oregon-based Boneyard, which Deschutes acquired last year, increased dollar sales +59.8%.

The craft segment’s biggest loss leader was A-B’s Shock Top, which saw its dollar sales decline -23.1%, followed by A-B’s Elysian (-9.9%), Molson Coors-owned Leinenekugel’s (-8.7%), Boston Beer-owned Dogfish Head (-18.4%) and Gambrinus-owned Shiner (-9%)."
The Seltzer Brand all the Wholesalers are picking up,"THE SELTZER BRAND ALL THESE WHOLESALERS ARE SCOOPING UP 

This week, Sonic Hard Seltzer will hit eight new states, for a total of 39.

The new states include Alaska, California, Maryland, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin. 

The brand is going with a mix of mostly A-B and craft/wine & spirits houses, including the Bud network in New York “for 35% of state, including Clare Rose, Saratoga Eagle, Dana, Dutchess, Bertoline with more to follow”; Northern California “led by Delta Pacific and Mussetter, with SoCal coming in the next few days”; Pennsylvania with Penn Beer across 40% of the state; Maryland with Chesapeake “for 45% of state with more to follow”; Alaska statewide with RNDC; and more to follow, in many of these cases. 

“In all, we have launched with 23 new distributors covering 35 million in population (slightly more than 10% of total US population) over the past 45 days,” Sean Mossman, President of COOP Bev Works, the wholly owned subsidiary behind Sonic Hard Seltzer (and soon more such licensed products), tells BBD. 

“We now cover 64% of total US population with 213 distributors. We launched Sonic last May in OK with one distributor.

“We expect to be statewide in each of these states by year’s end, at the latest. We are in productive negotiations with distributors that should add 49 million in population, which will push us beyond 75% of the country by Q4 2022.”

These new markets will also get the recently announced new Sonic Hard Southern Sweet Tea and Sonic Hard Slush brands [see CBD 07-01-2022], which will hit in September. 

BUT ISN’T SELTZER DEAD? Most of our coverage over the last few months has centered on seltzer’s fall from growth trends. Indeed, the segment is down low-single digits YTD, and was even down 18% for the week ended July 3. 

But Sean tells BBD that despite the general slowdown in seltzer, the Sonic brand is seeing significant growth in its existing footprint, and realizing low-single-digit share in many markets. 

They launched the original Sonic Hard Seltzer product in Oklahoma in May of last year, then expanded to seven additional states in October of 2021. After securing supply chain and can contracts and building out their wholesaler network with an eye toward Q1 chain resets, “the big expansion was in March,” where they went from seven states to 31 states. 

“And since we’ve moved into the 31 states … we’ve seen our Nielsen tracked retail sales from March to May go up 166%,” said Sean. “So we’re seeing really great organic growth inside the markets that we’ve expanded into.”

RUNNIN AT A 2-5 SHARE OF SELTZER IN MANY MARKETS. They’ve also seen velocity and dollars per point of distribution on the same shelf go up “34%” since January. 

“So our velocity numbers are significantly increasing. And we’re seeing some green shoots in some of our early markets: Tennessee, New Mexico, Mississippi for instance, are running somewhere in the 2.5 to 3 share of seltzer only 60 days into the launches of those markets.”

Meanwhile, in the more mature Texas and Arizona markets they’re “running around a 2 in Texas and a 3 in Arizona, which was an October state.

“So we’re settling in that two-five [share] range depending where [we] are and how mature the market is. And quite frankly, there’s a correlation, a little bit of a correlation to Sonic restaurant saturation.” They’re doing better in the Southern half, where the Sonic brand equity is strongest. 

We wondered if they’ve switched any distribution partners, or stayed the course.

They’re only switched in the state of Oklahoma. 

“We were statewide [with their craft brands] with Republic National in Oklahoma,” says Sean, but the Molson Coors network recently went to RNDC and brokered a deal to purchase distribution rights for COOP brands in the state.

Other than that, “we’re with the same distribution network, market to market, that we signed originally when the Sonic Seltzer program came out.” 

They also did move from Buquet to Mockler in Louisiana, but that was due to wholesaler consolidation. (BBD reported in March that Longtime Louisiana A-B distributor Buquet Distributing of Houma [about 1.9 million case equivs/year], was selling its operation to Mockler Beverage of Baton Rouge.) 

ANNOUNCING NEW PARTNERS SOON. Those who read CBD know that Sean also shared some compelling news with the outlet earlier this month: imminent new partnerships.

Right before July 4, Sean told CBD to expect a new sports-focused marketing deal from the company — as well as a new announcement on additional partners, to leverage their brand equity in the bev alc space [see CBD 07-01-2022].

Sean shared more with BBD: The release on the sports partnership is August 15,” he says. Moreover, “We hope to be ready to announce an additional partner around September 1.”"
The Latest in Bud Light Add campaign,"After A-B’s announcement last month that it would put Bud Light’s lead creative agency, Wieden + Kennedy, up for review, the brand has since whittled contenders to three —  Anomaly, Johannes Leonardo and The Martin Agency, “according to multiple people close to the situation,” per AdAge.

The final decision will come this fall, and with it, more on new campaign work for the brand.  

W+K, which hatched the iconic “Dilly Dilly” campaign, abstained from the runnings after about 7 years of service to Bud Light. But it will continue to work “on Budweiser global, Michelob Ultra, Corona, Nutrl vodka seltzer and the AB InBev corporate brand.”

Among current contenders, Anomaly and The Martin Agency have existing ties to A-B/ABI. 

But the agency review developments loom small amid the larger question: Where are the marketing campaigns for beer’s biggest brand? 

In February, BBD reported Bud Light Marketing VP Andy Goeler’s promise of a new creative direction and campaign for Bud Light. 

He told his Samcom audience that A-B and its system wanted to take the brand’s marketing from “funny” to something “a bit more inspiring,” and looking on “the bright side of life.” The tagline seemed to be developing along the lines of something like, “this will be good.” Andy said they had work in progress, with actual content slated for summer [see BBD 02-04-2022]. 

But apparently the plan has changed. Again, all signs point to at least fall for new creative direction. 

A CHANGE OF GUARD, AND A SEA CHANGE FOR BUD LIGHT. How did we get here? The AdAge article points out that this review comes amid quite the shakeup in marketing leadership. 

Benoit Garbe was announced as A-B’s new CMO last September, but a cascade of marketing changes have transpired even in the last couple of weeks and months. In early May, longtime Bud Light marketing VP Andy Goeler announced his retirement from A-B after 43 years, effective this December. 

Andy’s retirement news came with a host of other marketing changes for the company. A-B’s mainstream brands were cobbled under one group for marketing purposes, to be led by former Bud and Value marketing VP, Daniel Blake. His new role as Mainstream VP brings the Bud Light family under his scope. They also basically replaced Andy’s position with two roles to give Bud Light more focus: Alissa Heinerscheid was appointed Marketing VP, Head of Bud Light Blue.  And Steve Wolf is now Marketing VP, Head of Bud Light Extensions [see BBD 05-05-2022].

All sorts of seemingly new pivots have ensued –including A-B’s announcement last month to end its 30-plus year exclusivity deal for the Super Bowl.  That decision was the work of Spencer Gordon, A-B’s VP of Connections, whose role encompasses paid media, sponsorships, experiential/digital, and their internal creative agency, draftLine. Spencer was promoted after former VP Connections Azania Andrews departed earlier this year. (Molson Coors quickly announced its intentions to advertise during The Big Game; last week they told BBD they’ll run one 30-second spot during Super Bowl LVII next year.) 

One thing that hasn’t changed, however, is core Bud Light’s trends. 

It’s been bleeding volume for more than a decade, and indeed, it’s down almost 11% in cases, more than half a share point of beer, YTD in IRI multi-outlet and c-store channels to 6/12. The company has tried to triangulate Bud Light’s decline with flanking brands like Bud Light Seltzer. That seems to have worked some, at the stakes of constant churn. To wit, the new Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda Variety Pack is already a top 15 brand for the brewer, at almost a quarter share of beer dollars YTD, and 0.19 volume share. The slightly smaller Bud Light Seltzer Variety Pack, however, is down almost 30% in dollars and volume YTD.

A-B also curtailed its measured media spend on Bud Light last year, AdAge reported, citing Kantar numbers: its $127 million spend was down from $130 mill in 2020."
